# Market Segmentation and End-Consumers for Insulation in Tunisia

## 1. Who are the end-consumers (homeowners, landlords, hotels)?

- The main end-consumers for insulation products in Tunisia are:
  - **Homeowners** (urban and peri-urban, both new and existing homes)
  - **Landlords** (especially in urban rental markets)
  - **Hotels and hospitality sector** (driven by energy savings and comfort for guests)
  - **Commercial property owners** (offices, retail)
  - **Public sector (schools, hospitals, government buildings)**
- No official statistics provide a precise breakdown by segment, but industry sources and government programs (e.g., Promo-Isol) target both residential and commercial sectors, with a focus on urban homeowners and the hospitality industry.

**Conclusion:** Homeowners and hotels are the primary end-consumers, with landlords and commercial/public sectors also relevant.

## 2. What percentage of installations are for new builds versus retrofit projects?

**No public data or official statistics are available on the percentage split between new builds and retrofit insulation projects in Tunisia.**

- Government programs like Promo-Isol and ANME initiatives target both new and existing buildings, but do not publish a breakdown.
- Internationally, retrofits often dominate in mature markets, but in Tunisia, the split is not quantified in public sources.

**Conclusion:** No reliable data found on the share of new build vs. retrofit insulation installations in Tunisia.

## 3. How do decision-making responsibilities vary (e.g. homeowners vs. architects vs. contractors)?

- **Homeowners**: Typically make the final decision for single-family homes, especially for retrofits or self-built houses.
- **Architects**: Play a key role in specifying insulation in new builds, especially for higher-end or urban projects. Their influence is greater in the design phase and for compliance with energy efficiency codes.
- **Contractors/Builders**: Often select materials and methods for lower-cost or informal construction, especially when the homeowner is less involved or for speculative developments.
- **Developers**: In multi-unit or commercial projects, developers may make decisions based on cost and regulatory compliance.

**No quantitative data is available on the exact share of decision-making by role in Tunisia.**

**Conclusion:** Decision-making varies by project type: homeowners dominate in retrofits, architects in new builds, and contractors/developers in larger or speculative projects.

## 4. Are there specific regions or socioeconomic groups that adopt insulation more quickly?

- **Urban and coastal regions** (e.g., Grand Tunis, Sfax, Sousse) show higher adoption rates, driven by higher incomes, greater awareness, and more stringent building codes.
- **Socioeconomic factors:**
  - Higher-income households are more likely to invest in insulation, especially for comfort and energy savings.
  - The hospitality sector (hotels) in tourist regions (e.g., coastal areas) is more likely to adopt insulation for guest comfort and energy cost reduction.
  - Lower-income and rural households have lower adoption rates, often due to cost barriers and lack of awareness.
- **No official statistics provide adoption rates by region or income group.**
- A 2015 survey of 3,000 Tunisian households (Jridi & Nouri, 2015) found that energy-saving behaviors and investments are strongly correlated with income, education, and urban location. [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26568974)

**Conclusion:** Adoption is higher in urban, coastal, and higher-income groups; no precise adoption rates are published.
