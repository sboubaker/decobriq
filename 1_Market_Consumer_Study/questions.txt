1. Market & Consumer Study

a. What is the demand for home insulation products in Tunisia (volume/value)?
How much insulation material (m²) is currently installed annually in residential and commercial buildings?
Is demand growing, stable, or declining—and at what rate over past 5 years?
What role have government programs (e.g. Promo‑Isol) played in building insulation adoption?

b. Who are the end-consumers (homeowners, landlords, hotels)?
What percentage of installations are for new builds versus retrofit projects?
How do decision-making responsibilities vary (e.g. homeowners vs. architects vs. contractors)?
Are there specific regions or socioeconomic groups that adopt insulation more quickly?

c. What price ranges are customers willing to pay?
How does WTP differ between residential, commercial, and hospitality segments?
How price-sensitive is the market—do customers trade off aesthetics/performance?
Which payment models (one-time, installment, subsidized financing) are feasible?

d. How do Tunisian cultural aesthetics impact acceptance of visible insulation?
What design styles are prevalent—and how much variation is acceptable?
Do households prefer the insulation hidden or on visible feature walls?
What materials/textures/colors resonate with local interior design trends?

e. What communication channels build trust in recycled-material products?
Do customers trust eco-labels or peer reviews over influencer endorsements?
Which media (social, TV, community events) drive interest in green home solutions?
How important is transparent sourcing and storytelling to drive trust?

f. What about sales strategy ?
Which pilot partners (e.g. contractors or homeowners) have signed LOIs or expressed pre-order interest?
