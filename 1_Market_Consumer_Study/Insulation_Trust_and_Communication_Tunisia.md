## 2. Do customers trust eco-labels or peer reviews over influencer endorsements?

**No public data or studies quantify Tunisian customer trust in eco-labels, peer reviews, or influencer endorsements for insulation or green products.**

- Industry and NGO experience suggest that **peer reviews and recommendations from trusted community members or NGOs** are more influential than influencer endorsements.
- **Eco-labels** (when present and credible) can help, but awareness and understanding of eco-labels is still developing in Tunisia.
- Influencer marketing is less trusted for green products compared to peer/community validation.

**Conclusion:** Peer/community validation is most trusted; eco-labels are helpful but not yet widely recognized; influencer endorsements are less trusted for green products.

- Storytelling that highlights local impact, artisan stories, and environmental benefits resonates with consumers and helps differentiate products from greenwashing.
