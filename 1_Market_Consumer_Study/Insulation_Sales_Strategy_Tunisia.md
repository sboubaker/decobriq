# Sales Strategy and Pilot Partners for Insulation in Tunisia

## 1. What about sales strategy?

- The insulation market in Tunisia is served by a mix of direct sales (to contractors, developers, and large clients), distribution through building materials suppliers, and project-based bidding for industrial and commercial projects.
- Leading companies (e.g., Isolmax, Afrikisol, IsolMeg) emphasize:
  - **Technical expertise and custom solutions** for industrial and commercial clients
  - **Partnerships with contractors and developers** for new construction and retrofits
  - **Participation in trade shows and industry events** (e.g., FITA, Green Technology Expo, PETROAFRICA) to build brand awareness and network with potential clients [Afrikisol](https://www.afrikisol.com/language/en/), [Isolmax LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/isolmax-tunisie)
  - **Eco-construction and green building platforms** (e.g., ebniecolo.tn) for outreach to environmentally conscious clients [Ebniecolo](https://ebniecolo.tn/)
- For residential customers, sales are typically through building supply stores or direct from installers; for industrial/commercial, through direct negotiation and project tenders.
- **No public data quantifies the market share of each channel or the effectiveness of specific strategies.**

**Conclusion:** Sales strategies combine direct sales, partnerships, and event participation; no quantitative data on channel effectiveness is available.

## 2. Which pilot partners (e.g. contractors or homeowners) have signed LOIs or expressed pre-order interest?

**No public data or industry reports list specific contractors, homeowners, or pilot partners who have signed Letters of Intent (LOIs) or expressed pre-order interest for insulation pilot projects in Tunisia.**

- Industrial and commercial insulation projects (e.g., Afrikisol, Isolmax) are often based on direct contracts with large clients in oil & gas, food industry, and construction, but details are not publicly disclosed.
- Green building and eco-construction platforms (e.g., ebniecolo.tn) promote pilot projects and partnerships, but do not publish lists of LOIs or pre-orders.
- For residential pilots, no public information is available on signed LOIs or pre-orders.

**Conclusion:** No public information on specific pilot partners, LOIs, or pre-orders for insulation projects in Tunisia.
