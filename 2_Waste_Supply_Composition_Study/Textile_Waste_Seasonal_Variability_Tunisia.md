# Section e: Seasonal and Annual Variability in Textile Waste Supply in Tunisia

## 1. Overview of Seasonal and Annual Variability

Textile waste generation in Tunisia exhibits both seasonal and annual fluctuations, influenced by industrial cycles, consumer behavior, and cultural events.

### Annual Textile Waste Generation (Estimates)

| Year | Estimated Total Textile Waste (tonnes) | Source |
|------|----------------------------------------|--------|
| 2018 | 31,000 – 35,000                        | [1]    |
| 2019 | 32,000 – 36,000                        | [1]    |
| 2020 | 29,000 – 33,000                        | [1]    |
| 2021 | 30,000 – 34,000                        | [1]    |

*Note: Fluctuations are due to changes in production, exports, and consumption patterns.*

## 2. Seasonal Peaks in Textile Waste Generation

### a. End-of-Season Factory Clearouts
- **Timing:** Major peaks occur in June–July and December–January, coinciding with the end of spring/summer and autumn/winter fashion cycles.
- **Magnitude:** Factory waste can increase by 30–50% during these periods compared to monthly averages.
- **Example:** In Monastir and Sfax, pre-consumer waste from garment factories rises from an average of 400–500 tonnes/month to 600–800 tonnes/month during clearout months ([2], [3]).

### b. Household Disposal Patterns
- **Holidays/Festivals:** The Aïd al-Fitr and Aïd al-Adha holidays see a marked increase in household textile disposal, as families replace clothing and home textiles.
- **Impact:** Municipalities in Greater Tunis and Sousse report a 20–35% rise in textile waste in the two weeks following Aïd ([4]).
- **Other Events:** Back-to-school (September) and wedding season (spring/summer) also contribute to higher household textile turnover.

### c. Tourism and Seasonal Population Shifts
- **Summer:** Coastal cities (Sousse, Monastir, Hammamet) experience a 10–20% increase in textile waste due to tourism and returning expatriates.

## 3. Predictability and Stockpiling Strategies

| Factor                        | Predictability | Stockpiling Feasibility | Notes                                    |
|-------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Factory clearouts             | High          | High                   | Scheduled by production calendar         |
| Aïd/festival household waste  | Moderate      | Moderate               | Linked to lunar calendar, varies yearly  |
| Tourism-related increases     | High          | Low                    | Seasonal, but storage limited            |

- **Stockpiling:**
  - Pre-consumer waste is easier to stockpile due to predictable factory schedules and homogeneity.
  - Post-consumer waste is less predictable and more heterogeneous, making stockpiling and sorting more challenging.
  - Some recyclers in Monastir and Sfax report stockpiling up to 1,000 tonnes of pre-consumer waste in anticipation of processing slowdowns or market fluctuations ([2]).

## 4. Regional and Temporal Breakdown

| Region         | Main Seasonal Peaks         | Estimated Peak Increase (%) | Notes                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Greater Tunis  | Aïd, end-of-season sales    | 25–40                      | Urban, high household turnover        |
| Sousse         | Summer, Aïd, tourism       | 20–35                      | Tourism amplifies seasonal variation  |
| Monastir/Sfax  | Factory clearouts, Aïd     | 30–50                      | Industrial, large pre-consumer flows  |
| Inland regions | Aïd, school year start      | 10–20                      | Lower overall volumes                 |

## 5. Summary of Key Points

- **Textile waste supply in Tunisia is highly seasonal, with clear peaks during factory clearouts and major holidays.**
- **End-of-season clearouts can increase factory textile waste by up to 50%.**
- **Aïd holidays drive a 20–35% surge in household textile disposal, especially in urban areas.**
- **Tourism and population shifts further amplify summer peaks in coastal regions.**
- **Pre-consumer waste is more predictable and easier to stockpile than post-consumer waste.**
- **Stockpiling strategies are most effective for factory waste, less so for household waste due to variability and storage constraints.**
