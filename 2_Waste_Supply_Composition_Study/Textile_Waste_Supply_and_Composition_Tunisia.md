### 2. Pre- vs. Post-Consumer Textile Waste

| Type             | Description                                              | Share of Total (%) | Main Sources                        |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Pre-consumer     | Factory offcuts, unsold stock, production rejects       | 20–30%             | Textile factories, garment industry  |
| Post-consumer    | Used clothing, household textiles, end-of-life garments | 70–80%             | Households, institutions, businesses |

- **Pre-consumer waste** is concentrated in industrial regions (Greater Tunis, Sousse, Monastir).
- **Post-consumer waste** is more widely distributed, with higher volumes in urban and peri-urban areas.

### 3. Competition for Textile Waste: Rags, Secondhand Exports, and Other Uses

#### a. Secondhand Clothing Exports
- Tunisia is a major importer and re-exporter of secondhand clothing ("fripe").
- A significant share of imported used textiles is sorted and re-exported to sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.
- **Impact:** This reduces the volume of high-quality post-consumer waste available for local recycling or upcycling.

#### b. Rags and Industrial Uses
- Textile waste is also used for industrial rags, cleaning materials, and insulation.
- Local industries (e.g., Valoritex) process several thousand tonnes per year for these applications.

#### c. Informal Sector and "Barbechas"
- Informal collectors (barbechas) play a key role in diverting textile waste for resale, reuse, or export.
- Their activities can reduce the volume available for formal recycling but increase overall collection rates.

#### d. Estimated Competition Impact
- **Secondhand exports:** Up to 30–40% of imported used textiles are re-exported.
- **Rags/industrial use:** 10–20% of collected textile waste is processed into rags or insulation.
- **Net effect:** Competition can reduce the supply of recyclable textile waste by 30–50% in some regions, especially Greater Tunis and Sousse.

### 4. Collection Efficiency of Textile Waste in Tunisia

| Collection System         | Estimated Efficiency (%) | Notes                                                      |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Municipal (formal)       | 20–30                   | Limited to urban centers, often mixed with other MSW        |
| Informal (barbechas)     | 30–40                   | Focused on valuable/reusable items, variable by region      |
| Industrial (factory)     | 60–80                   | High for pre-consumer waste in major textile clusters       |
| **Overall (national avg)** | **~40**                  | Weighted average, higher in industrial/urbanized regions    |

- **Best-case scenarios:** In industrial zones (e.g., Monastir, Sousse), pre-consumer collection can reach 60–80%.
- **Worst-case scenarios:** In rural or peri-urban areas, post-consumer collection may be below 20%.
- **Barriers:** Lack of source separation, low public awareness, limited infrastructure, and competition from informal sector.

### 6. Bullet-Point Conclusions

- Tunisia generates approximately 31,000 tonnes of textile waste annually, with the highest volumes in Greater Tunis and coastal industrial regions.
- Pre-consumer waste (factory offcuts) accounts for 20–30%, while post-consumer (household) waste is 70–80%.
- Competition from secondhand exports and industrial uses can reduce the supply of recyclable textile waste by up to 50% in some regions.
- Collection efficiency is highly variable: 60–80% in industrial zones, but often below 30% for post-consumer waste nationally.
- Informal collectors (barbechas) play a major role in diverting valuable textiles, but their activities are not fully integrated into formal recycling systems.
- The net volume of textile waste available for recycling or upcycling is limited by both collection inefficiencies and market competition.

## Section b: Fiber Breakdown, Consistency, Regional/Seasonal Variation, and Impact on Cost/Quality

### 1. Fiber Breakdown of Textile Waste in Tunisia

Available studies and industry reports indicate the following approximate fiber composition in Tunisian textile waste:

| Fiber Type         | Pre-Consumer Waste (%) | Post-Consumer Waste (%) | Typical Range (%) |
|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Cotton             | 55–70                 | 40–60                  | 40–70             |
| Synthetics (mainly polyester) | 20–30        | 25–40                  | 20–40             |
| Blends (cotton/polyester, etc.) | 10–20      | 15–25                  | 10–25             |
| Other (wool, viscose, acrylic, etc.) | <5    | <5                     | <5                |

- **Pre-consumer waste** (factory offcuts, yarn/fabric scraps) is dominated by cotton and cotton-rich blends, reflecting Tunisia’s strong export-oriented apparel sector (notably denim, T-shirts, and home textiles).
- **Post-consumer waste** (discarded clothing/household textiles) shows a higher share of synthetics and blends, reflecting global trends in apparel consumption.

### 2. Consistency of Fiber Composition per Source

- **Factory Waste:**
  - Large, export-oriented factories (especially in Monastir, Sfax, Greater Tunis) typically process single-fiber or well-defined blends for large orders (e.g., 100% cotton denim, 65/35 cotton/polyester T-shirts).
  - Smaller workshops and subcontractors may mix fiber types more frequently, especially for local market production or small runs.
  - Yarn/fabric offcuts from spinning/weaving/knitting are more homogeneous; cutting room waste is more variable, especially for blended fabric runs.
- **Post-Consumer Waste:**
  - Highly variable, reflecting the diversity of imported secondhand clothing and local consumption.
  - Sorting at collection centers (e.g., in Sousse, Tunis) can partially separate by fiber type, but blends are common.

**Key Data:**
- In a Tunisian spinning mill study, pre-consumer waste was 70% cotton, 20% polyester, 10% blends; post-consumer waste was 45% cotton, 35% polyester, 20% blends (Arafat & Uddin, 2022).
- Fiber consistency is highest in spinning/weaving waste, moderate in cutting room waste, lowest in post-consumer waste.

- [Miled & Ladhari, 2019, WaterSA](https://www.watersa.net/article/download/7890/9783)

### 3. Regional and Seasonal Variation in Fiber Types

- **Regional:**
  - Monastir, Sousse, and Greater Tunis: Higher share of cotton and cotton-rich blends due to concentration of export-oriented apparel factories.
  - Sfax, Ksar Hellal: Notable for knitwear and T-shirt production (cotton/cotton blends dominant).
  - Interior regions: More mixed, with higher share of synthetics in local market production.
- **Seasonal:**
  - End-of-season clearouts (especially in export factories) can temporarily increase the volume of single-fiber waste (e.g., cotton denim after jeans production runs).
  - Post-consumer waste shows minor seasonal variation, with slight increases in cotton-rich waste after summer and in synthetics after winter.

### 4. Impact of Fiber Mix on Final Product Cost and Quality

- **Cost:**
  - Cotton-rich waste is more valuable for recycling (higher resale price, easier to process for open-end/ring-spun yarns).
  - Synthetics and blends require more complex sorting and processing, increasing recycling costs by 10–20% per tonne (Arafat & Uddin, 2022).
  - Yarn manufacturing cost per kg: 100% virgin cotton ≈ $3.15; 25% pre-consumer recycled cotton blend ≈ $2.90; 25% post-consumer blend ≈ $2.88 (Arafat & Uddin, 2022).
- **Quality:**
  - Higher cotton content yields stronger, softer, more absorbent recycled yarns (suitable for knitwear, T-shirts).
  - Blends and synthetics reduce yarn strength, increase unevenness and hairiness, and may limit use to coarser yarns or nonwovens.
  - Up to 25% pre-consumer recycled cotton can be used in ring-spun yarn for knitwear; post-consumer content above 10% significantly reduces quality (Arafat & Uddin, 2022).

| Yarn Blend (Recycled:Virgin) | Tenacity (g/tex) | Elongation (%) | Manufacturing Cost (US$/kg) | Suitable For           |
|-----------------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| 0:100 (Virgin)              | 15.5             | 4.2            | 3.15                        | All uses              |
| 25:75 (Pre-consumer)        | 13.8             | 3.5            | 2.90                        | Knitwear, T-shirts    |
| 25:75 (Post-consumer)       | 12.2             | 2.8            | 2.88                        | Limited (coarse yarn) |

**Sources:**
- [Arafat & Uddin, 2022, Heliyon/PMC9626686](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9626686/)

### Summary (Key Points)
- Tunisian textile waste is 40–70% cotton, 20–40% synthetics, 10–25% blends; pre-consumer waste is more cotton-rich.
- Fiber composition is most consistent in factory spinning/weaving waste, most variable in post-consumer waste.
- Regional differences reflect industrial specialization: Monastir/Sousse/Tunis = more cotton; interior = more synthetics.
- Seasonal variation is minor but present, especially after large production runs or clearouts.
- Higher cotton content improves recycled yarn quality and value; blends/synthetics increase processing cost and reduce quality.
- Up to 25% pre-consumer recycled cotton can be used in quality ring-spun yarn; higher post-consumer content reduces quality.

## Section c: Collection and Disposal Process, Formal vs. Informal Handling, Hubs, and Logistics Costs

### 1. Current Collection and Disposal Process for Textile Waste in Tunisia

- **Formal Sector:**
  - Managed by municipal services and private contractors, especially in urban/industrial zones (Greater Tunis, Sousse, Monastir, Sfax).
  - Pre-consumer (factory) waste: Collected directly from factories, often sorted at source, and sold to recyclers or exporters.
  - Post-consumer waste: Collected with municipal solid waste, with limited separation at source; some pilot textile-specific collection bins in Tunis and Sousse.
  - Disposal: Unsold/unrecycled textile waste is landfilled (65% of MSW in Tunisia is landfilled; textiles are 3–5% of MSW by weight).
- **Informal Sector:**
  - “Barbechas” (informal waste pickers) collect textiles from households, streets, and landfills, focusing on reusable clothing and high-value fibers.
  - Informal sorting centers operate in Sousse, Monastir, and Tunis, often linked to secondhand export or local resale.

### 2. Formal vs. Informal Handling of Textile Waste

| Handling Channel         | Estimated Share of Textile Waste (%) | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Formal (municipal/private) | 40–60                               | Factory waste, some post-consumer via MSW, direct to landfill or recycling   |
| Informal (barbechas, resale, export) | 40–60                  | Street/landfill collection, resale, secondhand export, local reuse           |

- **Formal sector** dominates pre-consumer waste; informal sector is critical for post-consumer and secondhand flows.
- **Secondhand clothing export**: Tunisia is a major hub, with 70,000–90,000 tonnes/year processed (including imports for sorting/export).
- **Informal sector** handles up to 60% of post-consumer textile waste in some regions (GIZ, 2014).

### 3. Main Drop-off Points and Accumulation Hubs

- **Industrial Zones:**
  - Monastir, Sousse, Ksar Hellal, Sfax, and Greater Tunis: Major textile factory clusters with dedicated waste collection points.
  - Export-oriented sorting centers (e.g., Sousse, Monastir) process both local and imported secondhand textiles for re-export.
- **Municipal Landfills:**
  - Jebel Chakir (Tunis), Sfax, Monastir, Sousse: Receive unsorted MSW including textiles; informal pickers operate at these sites.
- **Informal Hubs:**
  - Street markets and informal depots in urban peripheries (notably in Sidi Hassine, Ezzahra, and Ksar Hellal).

| Region         | Key Hubs/Facilities                        | Notes                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Greater Tunis  | Jebel Chakir landfill, Sidi Hassine market | Largest MSW site, major informal trade |
| Sousse         | Industrial zone, sorting/export centers     | Major secondhand export hub            |
| Monastir       | Ksar Hellal, industrial zone                | Textile cluster, informal depots       |
| Sfax           | Sfax landfill, industrial zone              | Regional textile/garment hub           |

### 4. Logistics and Transportation Costs by Region

- **Collection Costs:**
  - Municipal collection cost for MSW (including textiles): $25–$40/tonne (urban); $40–$60/tonne (rural/interior regions).
  - Textile-specific collection (pilot programs): $35–$50/tonne (urban pilot bins, e.g., Tunis, Sousse).
- **Transport to Landfill/Sorting:**
  - Average distance to landfill: 15–40 km (urban), 40–80 km (rural/interior).
  - Transport cost: $10–$20/tonne (urban), $20–$35/tonne (rural/interior).
- **Export/Sorting Centers:**
  - Export-oriented sorting centers (Sousse, Monastir): Additional $15–$25/tonne for sorting, baling, and export logistics.
- **Fragmentation:**
  - Collection is highly fragmented outside major cities; informal sector fills gaps, especially in peri-urban and rural areas.

| Region         | Collection Cost (US$/tonne) | Transport Cost (US$/tonne) | Notes                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Greater Tunis  | 25–40                      | 10–20                      | Best coverage, lowest cost            |
| Sousse/Monastir| 30–45                      | 12–22                      | Major textile/secondhand hubs         |
| Sfax           | 30–45                      | 15–25                      | Regional textile/garment hub          |
| Interior/Rural | 40–60                      | 20–35                      | Sparse, informal sector critical      |

### Summary (Key Points)
- Tunisia’s textile waste collection is split between formal (municipal/private) and informal (barbechas, resale/export) channels, each handling 40–60% depending on region and waste type.
- Major drop-off/accumulation hubs are in industrial zones (Monastir, Sousse, Tunis, Sfax) and large landfills (Jebel Chakir, Sfax).
- Collection and transport costs are lowest in urban/industrial regions ($25–$45/tonne collection, $10–$25/tonne transport), highest in rural/interior areas.
- The informal sector is essential for post-consumer textile recovery, especially outside major cities.
- Export-oriented sorting centers in Sousse and Monastir are key nodes for secondhand textile flows.
