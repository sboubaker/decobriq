2. Waste Supply & Composition Study

a. How much textile waste is available across regions—pre- vs post-consumer?
What volume (in tonnes) is produced annually per region (Greater Tunis, Sousse, etc.)?
How will competition (e.g. rags, secondhand exports) affect supply?
What collection efficiency can be realistically achieved (e.g., 60–80%)?
What is the fiber breakdown (% cotton, synthetics, blends)?
How consistent is the composition per source—do factories mix fibers?
Are certain fibers more abundant in certain regions or times of year?
Does fiber mix impact final product cost or quality significantly?
 What's the current collection/disposal process—how fragmented is it?
What percent of textile waste is handled formally vs. informally?
Where are main drop-off points or accumulation hubs located?
How do logistics and transportation costs vary by region?

b. Can “barbechas” be legally integrated and incentivized?
Does current law allow paying informal collectors or must they register?
Could cooperative models legally formalize and serve as collection hubs?
What incentive structures (per kg payment, credit) resonate best?

c. What's the seasonal/annual variability in textile waste supply?
Are there peaks (e.g. end-of-season factory clearouts)?
How predictable are these cycles and how can we stockpile accordingly?
Do holidays or festivals (e.g. Aïd) affect household textile disposal patterns?
