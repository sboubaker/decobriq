# Section d: Legal Integration and Incentivization of “Barbechas” (Informal Textile Waste Collectors) in Tunisia

## 1. Legal Status and Integration of Informal Collectors

- **Current Legal Status:**
  - “Barbechas” (informal waste pickers) operate outside the formal waste management system.
  - Tunisian law (Code des Collectivités Locales, Law 2018-29) does not explicitly recognize informal collectors as legal waste management actors.
  - Municipalities have the authority to contract with private companies or cooperatives for waste collection, but most contracts are with formal enterprises.
  - Informal collection is tolerated but not formally regulated or protected; collectors risk fines or confiscation if found operating in restricted areas (e.g., inside landfills without authorization).

| Status                | Legal Recognition | Risk of Fines/Confiscation | Notes                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Barbechas (current)   | No               | Yes                       | Tolerated, not protected              |
| Registered cooperative| Yes (possible)   | No                        | If registered as cooperative/SME      |

## 2. Payment and Registration Requirements

- **Direct Payment:**
  - Municipalities and private companies are not legally allowed to pay unregistered individuals for waste collection services.
  - Payment is possible if collectors are registered as:
    - Individual entrepreneurs (auto-entrepreneur status)
    - Members of a cooperative (coopérative)
    - Employees of a registered SME
  - Registration requires:
    - National ID, proof of address, and sometimes a clean criminal record
    - Cooperative statutes and registration with the Ministry of Employment or Agriculture

| Payment Channel         | Legal? | Requirements                        |
|------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| Direct to informal     | No     | Not allowed                         |
| To registered cooperative | Yes | Cooperative registration, contracts  |
| To SME/entrepreneur    | Yes    | Business registration, contracts     |

## 3. Cooperative Models for Legal Formalization

- **Legal Framework:**
  - Law 2005-94 (Cooperative Law) allows the creation of waste management cooperatives.
  - Cooperatives can sign contracts with municipalities for collection, sorting, and recycling services.
  - Members are entitled to social security, training, and can receive municipal or donor support (e.g., equipment, microcredit).
- **Examples:**
  - Pilot textile waste cooperatives in Sousse and Monastir (supported by GIZ and local NGOs) have shown increased income and social protection for members.
  - As of 2022, fewer than 10 waste picker cooperatives are formally registered in Tunisia, but the model is expanding.

| Model         | Legal? | Benefits                        | Challenges                       |
|--------------|--------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Cooperative  | Yes    | Social security, contracts, support | Bureaucracy, need for training   |
| Informal     | No     | Flexibility, no paperwork         | No protection, no legal payment  |

## 4. Incentive Structures: What Works Best?

- **Per-Kilogram Payment:**
  - Most effective and preferred by collectors; typical rates: 0.10–0.20 TND/kg for textiles, 0.20–0.40 TND/kg for plastics/metals (2022 data, Sousse pilot).
- **Credit/Microcredit:**
  - Some cooperatives offer microcredit or advance payments for equipment (carts, protective gear).
- **Social Benefits:**
  - Access to health insurance, training, and social security is a strong incentive for formalization.
- **Recognition/Contracts:**
  - Official contracts with municipalities or companies provide income stability and legal protection.

| Incentive Type         | Typical Value/Structure         | Collector Preference | Notes                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Per-kg payment        | 0.10–0.20 TND/kg (textiles)      | High                | Most direct, transparent     |
| Microcredit/equipment | 100–500 TND per collector        | Medium              | For carts, PPE, etc.         |
| Social benefits       | Health insurance, training       | High                | Only via formalization       |
| Contracts             | 6–12 months, renewable           | High                | With municipality/cooperative|

## Summary (Key Points)
- Barbechas are not legally recognized as waste management actors unless they register as cooperatives, SMEs, or entrepreneurs.
- Direct payment to informal collectors is not allowed; legal payment requires registration and contracts.
- Cooperative models are legally possible and offer social protection, but require registration and training.
- Per-kg payment, social benefits, and official contracts are the most effective incentives for integration.
- Fewer than 10 waste picker cooperatives are currently registered, but pilot projects show positive results.
