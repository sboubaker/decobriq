# Risk & Resilience: Waste Supply and Demand Fluctuations in Tunisia

## Section a. What happens if waste supply dips or demand slows?

### 1. Overview of Textile Waste Supply in Tunisia
Tunisia generates over 31,000 tons of textile waste annually, with Monastir as a major hub, but significant volumes are also produced in Sfax, Sousse, Mahdia, Ariana, and Bizerte. The textile sector is highly concentrated in the coastal and central regions, but supply chains exist nationwide.

### 2. Backup Suppliers Beyond Monastir
Key textile waste suppliers outside Monastir include:
- SITEX (Ksar Hellal, Monastir/Sousse)
- UCT Textile (Mahdia)
- Textile Fashion Tunisia (Bizerte)
- Valoritex (nationwide, with logistics in Sfax, Sousse, and Mahdia)
These companies are part of a national circular textile network, enabling supply chain resilience by sourcing from multiple regions.

### 3. Mitigating Supply Dips
- Diversification of suppliers across regions (Monastir, Sfax, Sousse, Mahdia, Bizerte) reduces risk of local disruptions.
- Partnerships with waste management companies and municipalities can secure additional feedstock during shortages.
- National initiatives (e.g., GTEX/MENATEX) support regional textile collection and recycling, increasing resilience.

#### **Supply Chain Resilience Chart**
| Region      | Major Suppliers/Partners         | Notes                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Monastir    | SITEX, Beni Hassen Textile       | Main textile hub                       |
| Sfax        | Valoritex, local recyclers       | Secondary supply, logistics center     |
| Sousse      | SITEX, Valoritex                 | Integrated with Monastir supply chain  |
| Mahdia      | UCT Textile                      | Regional backup, growing capacity      |
| Bizerte     | Textile Fashion Tunisia          | Northern supply, less concentrated     |
| Ariana      | TŪNIQ, other artisans            | Niche, artisanal supply                |

### 4. Demand Slowdown: Flexibility in Product Lines
Tunisian textile recyclers have successfully shifted to alternative products during demand slumps, including:
- Fillers for construction and automotive sectors
- Artisanal bags and home décor (e.g., TŪNIQ, Qartaj, Coin d'art)
- Cleaning rags and geotextiles (Valoritex)
These product lines use similar raw materials and can be ramped up or down based on market demand.

### 5. Cost of Idling vs. Selling Off Equipment
Idling costs include fixed labor, maintenance, insurance, and utilities. For a small Tunisian recycling facility:
- Fixed monthly costs: $5,000–$20,000 (rent, salaries, utilities)
- Maintenance: 10–15% of annual operating expenses
- Insurance: 3–5% of annual expenses
Selling off equipment can recover 30–50% of initial investment, but may incur losses if market conditions are poor.

| Cost Category         | Monthly Estimate (USD) | Notes                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Facility Lease       | $5,000–$15,000         | Varies by region and size             |
| Labor (core staff)   | $3,000–$10,000         | Minimum staff for maintenance         |
| Utilities            | $1,000–$3,000          | Electricity, water, waste             |
| Maintenance          | $500–$2,000            | Preventive and emergency repairs      |
| Insurance            | $200–$800              | Facility and equipment coverage       |

Selling equipment may be preferable if a prolonged downturn is expected, but idling allows for rapid restart if demand recovers.

### 6. Summary Table: Resilience Strategies
| Risk Scenario         | Mitigation Strategy                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Supply dip           | Diversify suppliers, partner with municipalities    |
| Demand slowdown      | Shift to fillers, bags, rags, home décor            |
| Prolonged downturn   | Consider equipment sale vs. idling                  |
| Regional disruption  | Source from Sfax, Sousse, Mahdia, Bizerte, Ariana   |

## Bullet-Point Conclusions
- Tunisia’s textile waste supply is regionally diversified, with backup suppliers in Sfax, Sousse, Mahdia, Bizerte, and Ariana.
- National circular economy initiatives and partnerships with waste management companies enhance supply chain resilience.
- Product line flexibility (fillers, bags, rags) allows adaptation to demand fluctuations.
- Idling costs are significant but may be justified if demand is expected to recover; selling equipment is a last resort.
