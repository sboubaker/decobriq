# Risk & Resilience: Fraud, Theft, and Embezzlement Risks in Tunisian Textile Recycling

## Section d. What are the risks of fraud, theft, or embezzlement, and how can they be mitigated?

### 1. Overview of Fraud, Theft, and Embezzlement Risks

Textile recycling businesses in Tunisia face risks of fraud (e.g., false invoicing, asset misappropriation), theft (raw materials, finished goods, equipment), and embezzlement (misuse of company funds). These risks are heightened by the high value of textile waste and finished recycled products, as well as the cash-based nature of some transactions in the sector.

### 2. Regulatory and Legal Framework

Tunisia has strengthened its anti-fraud and anti-money laundering framework in recent years. The Commission Tunisienne des Analyses Financières (CTAF) is the national authority for financial crime, requiring businesses to report suspicious transactions and implement internal controls. The law (Loi organique n° 2015-26, amended 2019) mandates:
- Internal controls and regular audits
- Segregation of duties
- Reporting of suspicious activities to CTAF
- Staff training on fraud detection
