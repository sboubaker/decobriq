# Risk & Resilience: Subsidies, Policy Incentives, and Financial Planning in Tunisian Textile Recycling

## Section b. How dependent is the model on subsidies or policy incentives?

### 1. Overview of Subsidies and Policy Incentives in Tunisia (2024-2025)
- The 2025 Finance Act in Tunisia increased the standard corporate tax rate from 15% to 20%, but companies in recycling and green sectors (including textile recycling) remain eligible for a reduced 10% rate. Newly established enterprises (investment declaration in 2024 or 2025) are exempt from corporate and personal income taxes for four years, provided they start operations within two years and comply with Tunisian accounting standards. [UNCTAD Investment Policy Monitor, 2024](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/investment-policy-monitor/measures/4932/tunisia-increases-the-corporate-income-tax-and-introduces-incentives-for-new-investments-and-r-d)
- Additional incentives include a 50% deduction for R&D expenses (up to TND 400,000/year) and a further 50% deduction for innovation expenses, also capped at TND 400,000/year. [UNCTAD, 2024](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/investment-policy-monitor/measures/4932/tunisia-increases-the-corporate-income-tax-and-introduces-incentives-for-new-investments-and-r-d)
- Green economy projects, including recycling, can access dedicated credit lines (20 million TND) for investments in the circular economy, with favorable terms managed by Tunisian banks.

### 2. Can Margins Sustain Operations Without Grants or Tax Breaks?
- Textile recycling in Tunisia is capital- and energy-intensive, with major costs in labor, energy, and raw material procurement. Typical operating margins are tight, with energy and labor each representing 20–30% of costs, and procurement 20–40%. [Business Plan Templates, 2025](https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/textile-recycling)
- Without tax breaks or grants, profitability is highly sensitive to fluctuations in energy prices, labor costs, and raw material supply. The 10% corporate tax rate for recycling is a significant factor in maintaining positive margins. [PwC Tunisia, 2024](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/tunisia/corporate/deductions)
- Example: For a small Tunisian textile recycling facility, removing the 10% tax incentive would increase the effective tax burden by 100%, directly reducing net profit. [PwC Tunisia, 2024](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/tunisia/corporate/deductions)

| Cost Category         | % of Total OpEx | Notes                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Labor                | 20–30%          | Skilled technicians, management       |
| Energy               | 20–30%          | Electricity, gas, fuel                |
| Procurement          | 20–40%          | Raw textile waste, logistics          |
| Maintenance          | 10–15%          | Machinery upkeep                      |
| Waste Management     | 10–15%          | Disposal of non-recyclables           |
| Insurance/Legal      | 3–5%            | Compliance, risk management           |
| R&D/Innovation       | 5–15%           | Process improvement, new products     |

### 3. Absorbing Extra Costs if Policies Change
- If tax incentives or grants are reduced or removed, companies must either increase efficiency, raise prices, or reduce costs to maintain viability. [Business Plan Templates, 2025](https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/textile-recycling)
- The 2025 Finance Act also increased VAT on many goods and services to 19%, raising input costs for non-exempt businesses. Recycling companies must monitor VAT eligibility and seek exemptions where possible. [Facture Tunisie, 2025](https://facture-tunisie.com/411/fr/38/reglementations/principales-dispositions-de-la-loi-de-finances-2025)
- Energy and water costs in Tunisia are among the lowest in the region, but any subsidy reduction would have a direct impact on margins. [FIPA Tunisia, 2025](https://investintunisia.tn/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Couts-des-facteurs-FIPA-FR-Janvier-2025-1.pdf)

### 4. Planning Provisions or Reserves for Policy Shifts
- Best practice is to maintain a financial reserve equivalent to 3–6 months of fixed operating costs to absorb shocks from policy changes, such as tax increases or subsidy cuts. [Business Plan Templates, 2025](https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/textile-recycling)
- Scenario planning should include:
  - Sensitivity analysis for energy, labor, and tax changes
  - Regular review of government policy updates
  - Diversification of product lines and markets to reduce risk
- Tunisian banks and development agencies may offer bridge financing or emergency credit lines for companies affected by abrupt policy changes, but these are not guaranteed. [Facture Tunisie, 2025](https://facture-tunisie.com/411/fr/38/reglementations/principales-dispositions-de-la-loi-de-finances-2025)

| Risk Scenario         | Recommended Provision/Action                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Tax incentive loss   | Reserve 3–6 months OpEx, review pricing       |
| Energy subsidy cut   | Invest in efficiency, consider renewables     |
| Labor cost increase  | Cross-train staff, automate where possible    |
| VAT increase         | Monitor eligibility, optimize supply chain    |

## Bullet-Point Conclusions
- The Tunisian textile recycling sector is currently highly dependent on tax incentives (10% corporate tax rate) and access to green economy credit lines.
- Margins are tight; removal of incentives would significantly reduce profitability, especially for small and medium enterprises.
- Policy changes (tax, VAT, energy subsidies) can have immediate and material impacts on costs and margins.
- Best practice is to maintain a financial reserve of 3–6 months of fixed costs and to regularly review policy risks and mitigation strategies.
