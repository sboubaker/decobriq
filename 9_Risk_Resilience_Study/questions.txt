9. Risk & Resilience Study

a. What happens if waste supply dips or demand slows?
Do we have backup suppliers in regions beyond Monastir?
Can we shift product lines (e.g. fillers, artisanal bags) temporarily?
What is the cost of idling vs. selling off equipment?

b. How dependent is the model on subsidies or policy incentives?
Can margins sustain operations without grants or tax breaks?
If policies change, can we absorb extra costs?
Should we plan provisions or reserves for policy shifts?

c. Would cheap plastic insulation threaten us?
Are plastic panel imports taxed or price-competitive vs Deco'Briq?
How can we highlight eco-benefits to justify any price premium?
Can we negotiate local standards favoring recycled-material insulation?

d. How will disasters or power failures be handled?
Do we need backup generators, solar arrays, or UPS?
Is there insurance for factory damage, interruption, theft?
What contingency plan ensures supply chain continuity?
