# Section a: CO₂ and Water Savings per m² vs Conventional Insulation Materials in Tunisia

## 1. CO₂ eq. and Water Usage per m²: Textile Insulation (Deco'Briq) vs Mineral Wool, Foam, etc.

### Comparative Table: Embodied CO₂ and Water Use per m² of Insulation (Cradle-to-Gate)

| Material Type                | Thermal Conductivity (W/mK) | Density (kg/m³) | Embodied CO₂ (kg CO₂-eq/m²) | Water Use (L/m²) | Reference |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Mineral Wool (Rock/Glass)   | 0.035–0.045                 | 30–100          | 2.5–4.5                     | 15–30            | [10], [16]|
| Expanded Polystyrene (EPS)  | 0.032–0.040                 | 15–30           | 3.5–5.0                     | 5–10             | [10], [18]|
| Polyurethane Foam (PUR)     | 0.022–0.028                 | 30–40           | 5.0–7.0                     | 10–20            | [10], [26]|
| Textile Waste Insulation    | 0.035–0.045                 | 50–80           | 0.86–1.5                    | 2–8              | [10], [13], [35]|

**Note:**
- Values are for 1 m² of insulation achieving U = 0.20 W/m²K (Mediterranean climate, cradle-to-gate).
- Tunisian-specific LCA data is not available; values are based on European and Mediterranean studies ([10], [13], [16], [35]).

### Key Findings
- Textile insulation (Deco'Briq) offers 60–80% lower embodied CO₂ per m² than mineral wool or foam.
- Water use for textile insulation is also significantly lower (2–8 L/m²) than mineral wool (15–30 L/m²).
- Avoided impacts: Using textile waste diverts material from landfill/incineration, further reducing net CO₂ emissions ([35]).

## 2. Impact of Local Energy Mix and Water Scarcity on Results

- **Tunisia’s energy mix** is dominated by natural gas (~97% in 2022), with limited renewables ([UNEP, 2022](https://www.unep.org/resources/publication/2022-global-status-report-buildings-and-construction)).
- Lower-carbon energy mixes (more renewables) would further reduce the embodied CO₂ of textile insulation.
- Water scarcity in Tunisia makes low-water-use materials (like textile insulation) more attractive.
- No Tunisia-specific LCA for insulation found; results are extrapolated from Mediterranean/EU data.

## 3. Payback Period: Energy Saved vs Embodied Emissions

- **Payback period** = Time to offset embodied CO₂ by operational energy savings.
- For textile insulation in Mediterranean climates:
  - **Embodied CO₂**: ~0.86–1.5 kg CO₂-eq/m²
  - **Annual CO₂ savings** (vs uninsulated wall): ~5–10 kg CO₂-eq/m²/year ([41])
  - **Payback**: 1–3 months (operational savings quickly exceed embodied emissions)
- For mineral wool/EPS: Payback is 6–12 months due to higher embodied CO₂.

## 4. Summary Table: Key Performance Indicators

| Indicator                | Mineral Wool | EPS Foam | Textile Insulation |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------|--------------------|
| Embodied CO₂ (kg/m²)     | 2.5–4.5      | 3.5–5.0  | 0.86–1.5           |
| Water Use (L/m²)         | 15–30        | 5–10     | 2–8                |
| Payback Period (months)  | 6–12         | 6–12     | 1–3                |

## 5. Conclusions
- Textile insulation (Deco'Briq) offers major CO₂ and water savings per m² compared to mineral wool and foam, even when using conservative, non-Tunisian data.
- The payback period for embodied emissions is extremely short (1–3 months), making textile insulation highly effective for climate mitigation in Tunisia.
- Water use is also much lower, which is critical in Tunisia’s water-scarce context.
- **No authoritative, Tunisia-specific LCA data was found**; all results are based on best available Mediterranean/EU studies and should be validated with local data when available.
