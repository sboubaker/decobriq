# Section b: Microfiber Release, Dye Leaching, Worker Safety, and Performance Specs for Textile Insulation in Tunisia

## 1. Microfiber Release and Dye Leaching: Risks and Treatment Needs

### Microfiber Release During Shredding/Installation
- **No Tunisia-specific quantitative data** on microfiber release from textile insulation production or installation was found.
- International studies confirm that both natural and synthetic textile insulation can release microfibers during shredding, cutting, and installation, especially if mechanical processes are not contained ([Periyasamy, 2023](https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics11050406)).
- Microfiber release is higher for synthetic fibers (polyester, acrylic) than for natural fibers (cotton, wool), but all types can contribute to airborne and waterborne microfiber pollution.
- **Best practices:**
  - Use of local exhaust ventilation (LEV) at shredding/cutting stations
  - Enclosure of dust-generating processes
  - Regular cleaning with HEPA-filtered vacuums

### Dye Leaching and Chemical Additives
- Textile insulation made from post-consumer waste may contain residual dyes, heavy metals, and finishing chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde, PFAS, flame retardants).
- **Dye leaching** is a potential risk if insulation is exposed to water (e.g., leaks, condensation), but most studies show low leaching under normal building conditions ([Periyasamy, 2023](https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics11050406)).
- **Wastewater treatment:**
  - Tunisian textile factories are required to pre-treat dyeing effluents before discharge ([Miled & Ladhari, 2019](https://www.watersa.net/article/download/7890/9783)).
  - Advanced oxidation (Fenton), membrane bioreactors, and sand filtration can remove >80% of color and >90% of COD from dyeing wastewater.
  - For small-scale insulation production, sand or membrane filtration is recommended for process water.

## 2. Worker Safety: Dust Masks, Ventilation, and PPE

### Occupational Health Risks
- **Respiratory risks:**
  - High prevalence of occupational rhinitis (3.9% of all occupational diseases) and asthma among Tunisian textile workers, mainly due to dust and fiber inhalation ([Maoua et al., 2018](https://clinmedjournals.org/articles/ijrpm/international-journal-of-respiratory-and-pulmonary-medicine-ijrpm-5-088.pdf)).
  - Symptoms: nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, chest tightness; 40.5% of cases had severe nasal obstruction.
- **Protective measures:**
  - Use of FFP2/FFP3 (N95/N99) dust masks during shredding, cutting, and installation
  - Local exhaust ventilation at dust sources
  - Regular health monitoring and spirometry for workers
  - Protective clothing (coveralls, gloves)
- **PPE availability:**
  - In Egypt, only 7% of flax/textile workers always used dust masks; similar gaps likely in Tunisia ([El-Feky et al., 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-020-11588-0)).
  - Tunisian suppliers (e.g., Oxywear) provide certified PPE compliant with EN ISO 11612, EN 14116, and EN 1149-5 ([Oxywear](https://www.oxywear.com.tn/fr/)).

## 3. Wastewater Filters and Microfiber Removal
- **No Tunisia-specific regulations** for microfiber removal from small-scale insulation production wastewater.
- International best practice: Install 150–200 μm mesh filters on process water drains; membrane bioreactors or sand filtration for higher efficiency ([Periyasamy, 2023](https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics11050406)).
- Large Tunisian textile factories use membrane bioreactors, achieving >95% removal of suspended solids and color ([Chamam et al., 2017](https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/comparative-performances-of-an-activated-sludge-process-and-amembrane-bioreactor-for-the-treatment-of-a-textile-industry-effluent-2155-9821-1000310.pdf)).

## 4. Required R-Value, Acoustic, and Density Specs for Deco'Briq Bricks

### Thermal and Acoustic Performance
- **No Tunisia-specific minimum R-value for textile insulation** found; most products follow European standards (EN 13171/EN 13162).
- **Typical values for textile insulation:**
  - Thermal conductivity (λ): 0.035–0.045 W/m·K
  - R-value (for 5 cm thickness): 1.1–1.4 m²·K/W
  - Density: 40–80 kg/m³
  - Acoustic absorption (αw): 0.7–0.9 (for 50 mm panel)
- **Tunisian building code** (NT 47.02, 2015):
  - For external walls in climate zone 2 (Tunis, Sousse, Sfax): U ≤ 0.7 W/m²·K (R ≥ 1.43 m²·K/W)
  - Textile insulation of 8–10 cm thickness typically meets/exceeds this requirement

| Property                | Typical Value (Textile Insulation) | Reference |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| Thermal Conductivity λ  | 0.035–0.045 W/m·K                   | [10], [13]|
| R-value (5 cm)          | 1.1–1.4 m²·K/W                      | [10], [13]|
| Density                 | 40–80 kg/m³                         | [10], [13]|
| Acoustic Absorption αw  | 0.7–0.9 (50 mm)                     | [13]      |

## 5. Summary and Recommendations
- Microfiber and dye leaching are recognized risks; best practices include LEV, PPE, and wastewater filtration.
- Worker respiratory protection is critical; FFP2/FFP3 masks and ventilation are recommended.
- No Tunisia-specific microfiber regulations for small producers, but international standards can be followed.
- Deco'Briq bricks should target λ ≤ 0.045 W/m·K, density 40–80 kg/m³, and R ≥ 1.4 m²·K/W for 8–10 cm thickness to meet Tunisian code.
- **No authoritative, Tunisia-specific numeric data on microfiber release or dye leaching was found**; all recommendations are based on best available international/regional studies and Tunisian occupational health research.
