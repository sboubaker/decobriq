4. Environmental Impact & LCA Study

a. Calculate CO2 and water savings per m² vs conventional insulation materials.
What are CO2 eq. and water usage per m² of mineral wool, foam, etc., vs Deco'Briq?
Can our local energy mix or water scarcity change results?
What payback period (in energy saved vs embodied emissions) is realistic?

b. Quantify microfiber release or dye leaching – is treatment required?
During shredding or installation, are microfibers likely to release?
Do we need dust masks or ventilation systems to protect workers?
Would wastewater filters need microfiber-poor outflow?
What thermal/acoustic R-value and density specs must our Deco'Briq bricks meet?

c. Do reused-textile panels meet international/Gulf/EU environmental standards?
What tests (ISO, EN, ASTM) are needed to certify fire resistance and VOCs?
Are there standards for acoustic performance we must meet locally?
What is the cost/time for each compliance test?

d. Can materials qualify for ecolabels (ISO 14001, national green standards)?
Which Tunisian standards (e.g., TTGT, NT 105.0x) are relevant?
What's required to get ISO 14001 or equivalent third-party certification?
Can we get EU ecolabels for export products?
