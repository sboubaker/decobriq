# Pilot Lab Setup and Equipment for Composite Panels in Tunisia

## Section a. What lab or pilot setups are needed for composite panels?

### 1. Overview of Composite Panel Pilot Labs in Tunisia

Tunisia hosts several advanced composite material companies (e.g., Solutions Composites, SOREPCO, RC-Composite) with pilot and production facilities. A typical pilot lab for composite panels includes:
- A dedicated workshop space (minimum 50–100 m² for pilot scale)
- Controlled environment for material storage and curing
- Access to utilities (ventilation, compressed air, water, 3-phase electricity)

### 2. Minimum Pilot-Production Capacity to Prove Viability

Industry practice in Tunisia and internationally suggests that a pilot line should demonstrate at least 100–200 m² of composite panel production per month to validate technical and economic viability. This allows for:
- Multiple production runs
- Quality and durability testing
- Sufficient sample volume for certification and market trials

If the goal is to supply initial demonstration projects (e.g., a small building or several rooms), a pilot capacity of 200–500 m²/year is recommended.

| Pilot Scale | Monthly Output (m²) | Annual Output (m²) |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Minimum     | 10–20              | 120–240            |
| Typical     | 100–200            | 1200–2400          |
| Demo-ready  | 200–500            | 2400–6000          |

### 3. Essential Lab Equipment (Incubators, Presses, etc.)

A pilot lab for composite panels in Tunisia typically requires:
- **Hydraulic or heated press** (for panel forming and curing)
- **Vacuum infusion system** (for resin transfer molding)
- **Oven or climate chamber** (for controlled curing)
- **Cutting and finishing tools** (CNC router, saws, sanders)
- **Material testing equipment** (tensile tester, flexural tester, hardness tester)
- **Incubators or environmental chambers** (for accelerated aging and durability tests)
- **Mixers and dispensers** (for resin and additives)
- **Personal protective equipment (PPE)** and safety systems

Local suppliers such as Labtech Tunisia and SOREPCO provide a wide range of lab and process equipment, including presses, ovens, incubators, and testing machines.

### 4. Permits Needed for Small-Scale Biotech and Composite Labs

In Tunisia, running a small-scale biotech or composite pilot lab typically requires:
- **Business registration** (as an industrial or R&D entity)
- **Environmental impact assessment** (for chemical use and waste)
- **Health and safety compliance** (laboratory safety standards)
- **Municipal permits** (for workshop/lab operation)
- **Import permits** (for certain chemicals or specialized equipment)

Permitting is managed by the Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Environment, and local municipalities. The Market Access Portal provides up-to-date requirements for specific activities.

> **Note:** Requirements may vary by region and project scale. Early consultation with local authorities and the Market Access Portal is recommended.

### 5. Bullet-Point Conclusions

- A pilot lab for composite panels in Tunisia should have at least 50–100 m² of dedicated space and demonstrate 100–200 m²/month output for viability.
- Essential equipment includes presses, vacuum systems, ovens, CNC tools, and material testers, all available from local suppliers.
- Permits required include business registration, environmental, health/safety, and municipal approvals.
- Early engagement with local authorities and suppliers is key to a compliant and efficient setup.
