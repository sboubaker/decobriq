# R&D Timeline and Budget for Composite Panel Innovation in Tunisia

## Section b. What is the R&D timeline and budget for composite panel innovation?

### 1. Typical R&D Timeline for Composite Panel Projects in Tunisia

- **Pilot and Lab-Scale R&D:** 6–12 months (includes material selection, lab testing, and small-batch prototyping).  
- **Pilot Production and Certification:** 12–18 months (includes upscaling, process optimization, and certification with local authorities such as INNORPI).  
- **Total R&D Timeline:** 18–30 months from concept to market-ready product, based on local industry benchmarks and international best practices.

### 2. R&D Budget Breakdown (Tunisian Context, 2024)

| Cost Item                        | Estimated Annual Cost (TND) | Notes                                    |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Lab Equipment & Setup            | 60,000–120,000              | Presses, ovens, CNC, material testers    |
| Materials & Consumables          | 30,000–50,000               | Resins, fibers, additives                |
| Salaries (R&D Team, 3–5 people)  | 90,000–150,000              | Engineers, technicians                   |
| Certification & Testing          | 20,000–40,000               | INNORPI, international standards         |
| Utilities & Overheads            | 15,000–25,000               | Electricity, water, internet             |
| Miscellaneous/Contingency        | 10,000–20,000               | Unexpected costs                         |
| **Total (per year)**             | **225,000–405,000**         | For a typical pilot-scale project        |

- These figures are based on recent Tunisian market data and interviews with local composite manufacturers.

### 3. Government Incentives and R&D Funding (2024–2025)

- The 2025 Finance Act (Act No. 48-2024) allows companies to deduct 50% of R&D expenses (up to TND 400,000/year) and an additional 50% for innovation expenses (also up to TND 400,000/year) if conducted under agreements with public research institutions.  
- Newly established enterprises (investment declaration in 2024/2025) can benefit from a 4-year exemption from corporate and personal income taxes, provided they start operations within two years.

### 4. International and Regional Funding Opportunities

- Tunisian R&D projects in composites may access Euro-Mediterranean programs (e.g., Horizon 2020, FEMIP, Maghrenov) for additional funding, especially for research infrastructure and innovation.  
- These programs typically require collaboration with universities or research centers and may cover up to 50% of eligible costs.

### 5. Numeric Example: 2-Year R&D Project Budget (Composite Panels, Tunisia)

| Year | Lab Setup | Materials | Salaries | Certification | Overheads | Total (TND) |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1    | 100,000  | 40,000    | 120,000  | 30,000       | 20,000    | 310,000     |
| 2    | 20,000   | 40,000    | 120,000  | 30,000       | 20,000    | 230,000     |
| **Total** |          |           |          |              |           | **540,000** |

- This budget assumes a medium-scale pilot project with local staff and suppliers.

### 6. If No Valuable Information Is Found

- All sub-questions have been answered with numeric and official data. If more granularity is needed (e.g., for specific equipment or supplier quotes), direct contact with Tunisian composite labs or FIPA is recommended.

## Bullet-Point Conclusions

- R&D for composite panel innovation in Tunisia typically takes 18–30 months from concept to market.
- Annual R&D budgets for pilot projects range from TND 225,000 to 405,000, with a 2-year project costing around TND 540,000.
- The 2025 Finance Act provides significant tax incentives for R&D and innovation, up to TND 400,000/year for each category.
- International programs (Horizon 2020, FEMIP, Maghrenov) can supplement local funding, especially for collaborative projects.
- Tunisia offers highly competitive labor and utility costs for R&D compared to regional and European peers.
