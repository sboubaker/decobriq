10. Scale-up & Tech Innovation Study

a. What lab or pilot setups are needed for composite panels?
How many mÂ² of pilot-production capacity is required to prove viability?
What lab equipment (incubators, presses) is essential?
What permits are needed to run small-scale biotech?

b. What R&D timeline/investment is needed for advanced products?
How many months & staff to develop first composite iteration?
What additional budget will cover testing, certification, materials?
Can we phase R&D alongside revenue-generating products?

c. Can predictive sorting (e.g. AI) be implemented locally?
Are local tech firms able to build textile-sorting vision systems?
Is there sufficient budget & team capability for pilot trials?
Will gains from material consistency offset technology costs?

d. Are partnerships with universities, UNIDO possible?
Which departments/universities focus on textile/recycling/biotech?
Do programs offer co-funding or shared labs?
What track record exist for successful collaborations?
Which Tunisian stakeholders (machinery suppliers, vocational centers, industry federations) can we partner with?
