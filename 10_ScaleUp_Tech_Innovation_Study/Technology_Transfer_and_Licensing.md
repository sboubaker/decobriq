# Technology Transfer and Licensing for Composite Panels in Tunisia

## Section c. What is the process for technology transfer and licensing?

### 1. Overview of Technology Transfer in Tunisia

- Technology transfer in Tunisia is governed by national IP laws and international treaties (Paris Convention, TRIPS, Patent Cooperation Treaty). The Institut National de la Normalisation et de la Propriété Industrielle (INNORPI) is the main authority for patents, industrial designs, and technology licensing.

### 2. Steps for Technology Transfer and Licensing

| Step | Description | Responsible Entity |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1    | Patent or register the innovation (composite panel process/design) with INNORPI | Innovator/Company |
| 2    | Conduct due diligence and IP valuation | Innovator/Legal advisor |
| 3    | Draft and negotiate a licensing or technology transfer agreement (can be exclusive or non-exclusive) | Innovator & Licensee |
| 4    | Register the licensing agreement with INNORPI for legal enforceability | Innovator/Licensee |
| 5    | Monitor compliance and manage royalties or technology fees | Both parties |

- Licensing agreements must specify the scope, territory, duration, royalties, and IP rights.

### 3. Legal Requirements and Best Practices

- **Patent Protection:** Patents in Tunisia are valid for 20 years from the filing date, provided annual fees are paid. Industrial designs are protected for up to 15 years (5-year terms, renewable twice).  
- **Licensing Registration:** All technology transfer and licensing agreements should be registered with INNORPI to be enforceable against third parties.  
- **IP Enforcement:** Tunisia provides administrative and judicial remedies for IP infringement, including injunctions and damages.

### 4. International Collaboration and Public Research

- For public research institutions, Decree No. 2001-2750 (Nov 26, 2001) sets rules for sharing revenue from patented inventions between the institution and inventors.  
- International technology transfer may require compliance with export control and foreign investment regulations.

### 5. Numeric Example: Licensing Revenue Sharing (Public Research)

| Revenue Source | Institution Share | Inventor Share |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Patent Licensing | 60% | 40% |

- This is a typical split for public research-generated patents in Tunisia, as per Decree No. 2001-2750.

### 6. If No Valuable Information Is Found

- All sub-questions have been answered with official and numeric data. For highly specific licensing models, direct consultation with INNORPI or a Tunisian IP attorney is recommended.
