5. Regulatory & Policy Study

a. What permits/licenses are needed (industrial, environmental, waste handling)?
Does shredding/dyeing/assembly require industrial zone approval?
What are ONAS water-discharge permit thresholds?
Is a separate permit needed for textile-based insulation?

b. What incentives exist (e.g. tax breaks, grants under SCP-NAP, TTGT)?
What tax exemptions are offered to startups under the Startup Act?
Are there grants/funding from SwitchMed or PNUE Chanels?
Are tariffs reduced on imported machinery under ENI or national policy?

c. Is EPR or landfill ban being introduced?
Does Tunisia plan to implement EPR rules for textiles or insulation products?
Are landfill taxes or bans scheduled that could increase waste disposal costs?
Could waste diversion targets incentivize our business?

d. What import/export, labeling, or quality regulations apply?
Are there mandatory CE marks or equivalent for insulation materials?
What customs codes apply to our panels for export to EU?
Are there restrictions on recycled-content labeling (e.g. “100% recycled”)?
What IP protections (patent/design certificate) and quality standards are needed for local export?
