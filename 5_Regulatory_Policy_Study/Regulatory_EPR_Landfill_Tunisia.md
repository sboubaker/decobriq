# Section c: EPR, Landfill Bans/Taxes, and Waste Diversion Targets for Textiles & Insulation in Tunisia

## 1. Is EPR or a Landfill Ban Being Introduced in Tunisia?

### Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)
- **As of July 2025, Tunisia has NOT formally introduced EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) for textiles, insulation, or packaging.**
- No official EPR law or regulation for textiles or insulation products is in force (source: [UNCTAD Investment Policy Monitor, 2024](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/investment-policy-monitor/measures/4932/tunisia-increases-the-corporate-income-tax-and-introduces-incentives-for-new-investments-and-r-d)).
- EPR is under discussion in the MENA region (notably in Egypt and Lebanon), but Tunisia has not yet adopted a national EPR framework for any sector.
- **Voluntary take-back and recycling initiatives exist for plastics and packaging, but these are not mandatory or regulated by law.**
- International best practice: EU EPR schemes for textiles require producers to finance collection and recycling, with targets of 50–65% diversion from landfill by 2025–2030 ([EU Directive 2018/851](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2018/851/oj)).

### Landfill Taxes or Bans
- **No landfill ban or landfill tax for textiles or insulation is currently scheduled in Tunisia (2025).**
- Municipal solid waste is typically landfilled; no specific landfill diversion targets for textiles or insulation are in force (source: [Ministère de l'Environnement, 2024](https://environnement.gov.tn/)).
- Tunisia’s National Waste Management Strategy (2023–2027) mentions the need to reduce landfill but does not set numeric targets or introduce landfill taxes for industrial or textile waste.
- **International reference:** EU landfill directive sets a maximum of 10% municipal waste to landfill by 2035; France and Germany have landfill taxes of €30–€100/tonne for non-recyclable waste.

### Waste Diversion Targets
- **No official waste diversion targets for textiles or insulation in Tunisia as of 2025.**
- The National Development Plan (2023–2025) and World Bank projects encourage waste reduction and circular economy, but without binding targets for the textile/insulation sector ([World Bank, 2024](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2024/03/15/tunisia-world-bank-projects-boost-food-security-economic-opportunities)).
- **Best available international data:** EU targets for textile waste collection and recycling: 50% by 2025, 65% by 2030.

## 2. Are EPR Rules Planned for Textiles or Insulation Products?
- **No official announcement or draft law for EPR on textiles or insulation in Tunisia as of July 2025.**
- Policy discussions are ongoing, but no timeline or draft legislation is available (source: [Ministère de l'Environnement, 2024](https://environnement.gov.tn/)).
- Neighboring countries (Egypt, Lebanon) are piloting EPR for plastics and electronics, but not yet for textiles.

## 3. Are Landfill Taxes or Bans Scheduled That Could Increase Waste Disposal Costs?
- **No landfill tax or ban for textiles/insulation is scheduled in Tunisia (2025).**
- General landfill fees for industrial waste are low (typically <10 TND/tonne), with no differentiation for textiles or insulation.
- **International reference:** France landfill tax: €54/tonne (2025), Germany: €100/tonne (2025).

## 4. Could Waste Diversion Targets Incentivize Textile/Insulation Recycling?
- **No binding targets in Tunisia as of 2025.**
- International experience shows that EPR and landfill taxes significantly increase recycling rates and create business opportunities for recyclers and manufacturers.

## Summary Table: EPR, Landfill, and Diversion Policy Status (Tunisia vs. EU)

| Policy Area                | Tunisia (2025)         | EU (Reference)                | Source/Reference |
|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| EPR for Textiles/Insulation| Not in force           | Mandatory by 2025–2030       | UNCTAD, EU       |
| Landfill Tax/Ban           | Not in force           | €30–€100/tonne, bans in some | EU, France, DE   |
| Diversion Target           | Not set                | 50–65% by 2025–2030          | EU Directive     |

## Bullet Point Summary
- **No EPR, landfill tax/ban, or diversion targets for textiles/insulation in Tunisia as of July 2025.**
- Policy discussions are ongoing, but no draft law or timeline is available.
- International best practice: EPR and landfill taxes drive recycling and waste diversion.
- Tunisia may adopt such measures in the future, but businesses should monitor policy developments.
