# Section a: Permits, Licenses, and Approvals for Textile Insulation Manufacturing in Tunisia

## 1. Required Permits and Licenses

### Overview Table: Key Permits for Textile-Based Insulation Manufacturing

| Permit/License Type                | Required For                                      | Authority/Reference                | Notes |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| Industrial Operating License       | All manufacturing activities                      | Ministry of Industry               | Standard for all factories |
| Environmental Impact Assessment    | Activities with potential environmental impact    | Ministry of Environment (ANPE)     | Required for new/expanded plants, see Decree 2005-1991 |
| Waste Handling Permit              | Handling, storage, or processing of textile waste | ANGED (National Waste Agency)      | Needed for waste collection, sorting, recycling |
| ONAS Water Discharge Permit        | Discharge of industrial wastewater                | ONAS (Office National de l'Assainissement) | Thresholds apply, see below |
| Industrial Zone Approval           | Activities in designated industrial zones         | Local Governorate/Industrial Zone Authority | Required for new industrial sites |
| Specific Textile Insulation Permit | (No separate permit found)                        | N/A                                | See below |

## 2. Does Shredding/Dyeing/Assembly Require Industrial Zone Approval?
- **Yes.** New manufacturing activities (including shredding, dyeing, and assembly of textile insulation) generally require location in an approved industrial zone, especially if they involve waste processing or chemical use.
- Approval is granted by the local governorate or the relevant industrial zone authority.
- Urban planning and land use regulations may restrict such activities outside designated zones.

## 3. ONAS Water-Discharge Permit Thresholds
- **ONAS (Office National de l'Assainissement)** requires a permit for any industrial discharge into the public sewer system.
- **Thresholds:**
  - For textile industry effluents, ONAS sets maximum allowable concentrations for key pollutants:
    - **COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand):** ≤ 1,000 mg/L
    - **BOD5 (Biochemical Oxygen Demand):** ≤ 400 mg/L
    - **Suspended Solids:** ≤ 600 mg/L
    - **pH:** 6.5–8.5
    - **Color:** No visible color after dilution (for dyeing operations)
    - **Temperature:** ≤ 35°C
    - **Heavy Metals:** Strict limits (e.g., Cr, Pb, Cd, Hg, Ni, Zn, Cu)
- Exceeding these thresholds requires pre-treatment before discharge or risk of fines/closure.
- **Fees:** As of 2024, the ONAS variable fee for compliant industrial discharge is 1.579 TND/m³, plus a fixed fee of 16.150 TND/quarter (see [FIPA 2025 Cost Factors](https://investintunisia.tn/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Couts-des-facteurs-FIPA-FR-Janvier-2025-1.pdf)).

## 4. Is a Separate Permit Needed for Textile-Based Insulation?
- **No specific, separate permit for textile-based insulation was found in Tunisian regulations as of 2024.**
- The activity is covered under general industrial, environmental, and waste management permits.
- If the process involves hazardous chemicals (e.g., certain dyes, binders), additional chemical handling permits may be required.
- For export, compliance with destination country standards (e.g., CE marking for EU) may be needed, but this is not a Tunisian permit.

## 5. Summary & Conclusions
- **Industrial, environmental, and waste handling permits are all required for textile insulation manufacturing in Tunisia.**
- **ONAS water-discharge permits** are mandatory, with strict pollutant thresholds for textile effluents.
- **Industrial zone approval** is required for new facilities, especially those handling waste or chemicals.
- **No separate permit** exists for textile-based insulation, but all general manufacturing and environmental rules apply.
- **Always consult the relevant authorities** (ANPE, ONAS, ANGED, Ministry of Industry) for the latest requirements before starting operations.
