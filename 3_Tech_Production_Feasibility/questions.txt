3. Tech & Production Feasibility

a. What machinery (shredders, presses, sewing systems) is available locally and at what cost?
What Tunisian, Chineese, european or Maghreb suppliers exist for industrial shredders?
What are lead times (e.g. importing delays, customs workflows)?
Which warranties, spare-parts, or service support are available locally?
What binders/coatings are needed, and can we produce/acquire them in Tunisia?

b. What technical skills and training programs exist (students, vocational)?
Which Tunisian institutes offer textile or mechanical training?
Are apprenticeship programs available (e.g. CITET, UTICA)?
What's the cost and timeline to train staff up to production level?

c. Can local manufacturers or service providers supply and maintain equipment?
Which local firms specialize in industrial machine maintenance?
What’s the average cost/time to service a shredder or sewing line?
Is preventive maintenance common or will we need to build capacity?

d. What's the energy and water consumption per m² of product?
How many kWh are needed for shredding/pressing per m²?
Is water usage negligible (dry process) or does anything require wet processing?
Are alternative power options (solar, off-peak rates) viable in Tunisia?

e. What waste or emissions are generated during production—how will they be treated?
Does shredding generate dust or microfiber—what filters are needed?
Are there any wastewater streams from cleaning/fabric prep?
What are disposal options/costs for any residual scrap?
