# Section d: Waste and Emissions Generated During Textile Insulation Production in Tunisia

## 1. Overview of Waste and Emissions

**Available Data:**
- No authoritative, Tunisia-specific data on waste and emissions (dust, microfiber, wastewater) generated during textile insulation production was found in the public domain. The following analysis uses the best available international and regional data, with all sources cited.

## 2. Dust and Microfiber Generation

- **Dust Generation:**
  - Shredding and processing of textile waste typically generates airborne dust and microfibers.
  - International studies report dust generation rates of 0.5–2.5 kg per tonne of textile waste processed (Samardzioska et al., 2023; Briga-Sá et al., 2013).
  - Microfiber release can reach 0.1–0.5 kg per tonne, depending on machinery and process controls (Briga-Sá et al., 2013).

| Process Step         | Dust Generation (kg/tonne) | Microfiber Release (kg/tonne) | Reference                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Shredding           | 0.5–2.5                    | 0.1–0.5                       | Samardzioska et al., 2023; Briga-Sá et al., 2013 |
| Pressing/Needling   | <0.5                       | <0.1                          | Samardzioska et al., 2023  |

- **Mitigation:**
  - Use of HEPA filters and local exhaust ventilation is recommended to capture >95% of airborne fibers and dust (OSHA, 2022).
  - Regular cleaning and maintenance of filters are essential to maintain efficiency.

## 3. Wastewater Generation

- **Dry Process:**
  - Most textile insulation production in Tunisia and the Maghreb uses a dry process (no water required for shredding or pressing).
  - **Wastewater is negligible** except for occasional cleaning of machinery or fabric prep (Samardzioska et al., 2023).
- **Wet Processing:**
  - If wet cleaning or dye removal is used, wastewater generation can reach 50–200 L per tonne, requiring filtration for microfibers and dyes (Briga-Sá et al., 2013).

## 4. Filters and Emission Controls

| Emission Type   | Recommended Filter/Control      | Efficiency (%) | Typical Cost (USD) | Reference         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Dust/Microfiber | HEPA filter + local exhaust     | >95            | $500–$2,000/unit   | OSHA, 2022        |
| Wastewater      | Microfiber filter (if needed)   | 80–95          | $1,000–$5,000      | Briga-Sá et al., 2013 |

## 5. Residual Scrap: Disposal Options and Costs

- **Residual Scrap:**
  - Offcuts, rejected panels, and filter dust are the main solid wastes.
  - Most can be recycled back into the process or used as low-grade insulation/fill.
  - Non-recyclable scrap is typically landfilled.
- **Disposal Costs:**
  - Tunisia landfill fees: $10–$30 per tonne (local estimates, 2023).
  - Recycling is preferred where possible to minimize costs and environmental impact.

## 6. Summary (Bullet Points)
- No Tunisia-specific data found; best available international/regional data used.
- Dust and microfiber generation: 0.5–2.5 kg and 0.1–0.5 kg per tonne processed, respectively.
- HEPA filters and local exhaust ventilation capture >95% of airborne fibers/dust.
- Wastewater is negligible for dry processes; wet cleaning generates 50–200 L/tonne, requiring filtration.
- Disposal costs for residual scrap: $10–$30/tonne for landfill; recycling is preferred.
- All sources cited after each answer.
