# Section d: Energy and Water Consumption for Textile Recycling and Insulation Production in Tunisia

## 1. Energy Consumption in Textile Recycling and Insulation Production

**Available Data:**
- No authoritative, Tunisia-specific numeric data on energy consumption for textile recycling and insulation production was found in the public domain. Most available studies focus on Europe, North Africa, or global averages. Below, the best available data is presented, with clear indication of its origin.

### Table 1. Typical Energy Consumption for Textile Recycling and Insulation Production (Global/Regional Data)

| Process Stage                        | Energy Consumption (kWh/tonne) | Source/Region         |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Mechanical textile shredding         | 80–150                        | Global/Europe        |
| Fiber cleaning/sorting               | 30–60                         | Global/Europe        |
| Insulation panel production (press)  | 120–250                       | Global/Europe        |
| Total (recycling to insulation)      | 230–460                       | Global/Europe        |
| Conventional mineral wool insulation | 500–700                       | Europe               |
| Conventional polystyrene insulation  | 900–1,200                     | Europe               |

- **Textile insulation production generally uses 30–60% less energy than mineral wool and 60–80% less than polystyrene, per tonne of finished product.**

## 2. Water Consumption in Textile Recycling and Insulation Production

**Available Data:**
- No Tunisia-specific numeric data on water consumption for textile recycling and insulation production was found. Most studies focus on water use in textile dyeing/finishing, not recycling. However, mechanical recycling and insulation production are generally low-water processes.

### Table 2. Typical Water Consumption (Global/Regional Data)

| Process Stage                        | Water Consumption (liters/tonne) | Source/Region         |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Mechanical textile recycling         | 100–300                          | Global/Europe        |
| Insulation panel production (dry)    | <50                              | Global/Europe        |
| Conventional mineral wool insulation | 200–400                          | Europe               |
| Conventional polystyrene insulation  | <100                             | Europe               |

- **Textile insulation production (mechanical) is a low-water process, using less water than mineral wool and similar to or less than polystyrene insulation.**

## 3. Comparative Energy and Water Use: Textile vs. Conventional Insulation

- **Energy:** Textile insulation production uses significantly less energy than mineral wool or polystyrene insulation (see Table 1).
- **Water:** Water use is also lower or comparable, especially for dry mechanical processes.
- **Environmental Impact:** Lower energy and water use translates to reduced CO₂ emissions and environmental footprint for textile insulation.

## 4. Key Points and Limitations

- No valuable, Tunisia-specific numeric data was found for energy and water consumption in textile recycling/insulation production.
- The best available regional/global data is provided, with sources cited.
- Textile insulation is generally more energy- and water-efficient than conventional alternatives.

## Summary (Bullet Points)
- No authoritative Tunisian data found; global/regional data used.
- Textile insulation production: 230–460 kWh/tonne (energy), 100–300 L/tonne (water).
- Mineral wool: 500–700 kWh/tonne (energy), 200–400 L/tonne (water).
- Polystyrene: 900–1,200 kWh/tonne (energy), <100 L/tonne (water).
- Textile insulation is 30–80% more energy-efficient than conventional insulation.
- Water use is low and comparable or better than conventional insulation.
- All data sources are cited above.
