# Section e: Certifications and Standards for Textile Insulation Products in Tunisia

## 1. Overview of Certification Requirements

**Available Data:**
- No authoritative, Tunisia-specific certification or standard for textile insulation products could be found in the public domain. Most Tunisian insulation products (including mineral wool and glass wool) follow European (EN) and international (CE) standards, with some local adaptation for fire and health safety.
- Below, the best available international/regional standards are summarized, with clear indication of their origin and relevance for Tunisia.

## 2. Key International and European Standards for Textile Insulation

| Standard/Norm                | Scope/Requirement                                      | Typical Value/Rating for Textile Insulation | Source/Region         |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| CE Marking (EU)              | General product safety, performance, traceability      | Required for EU market                      | Europe               |
| EN 13501-1                   | Fire classification of construction products           | B-s1,d0 (with facing), C-s2,d0 (unfaced)    | Europe               |
| EN 13171, EN 13162           | Thermal insulation products for buildings              | λ = 0.039–0.047 W/m·K                       | Europe               |
| EN 12086                     | Water vapor diffusion resistance                      | μ = 2.2 (typical)                           | Europe               |
| EN ISO 140-3, EN ISO 717-1   | Acoustic insulation, sound absorption                  | αw = 0.95, Rw = 20–42 dB                    | Europe               |
| EN 1609, ACERMI              | Moisture behavior, partial wetting                     | Wp = 6.66 kg/m²                             | France/Europe        |
| EOTA, ACERMI                 | Resistance to mold, insects, health safety             | Class 0 (no growth), 100% mortality (moths) | France/Europe        |
| REACH                        | Chemical safety, absence of hazardous substances       | Compliance required                         | Europe               |

## 3. Fire, Acoustic, and Health Standards

- **Fire Safety:**
  - Textile insulation (with plasterboard facing) can achieve B-s1,d0 fire rating (EN 13501-1), suitable for most building applications.
  - Unfaced textile insulation typically achieves C-s2,d0 or lower.
- **Acoustic Performance:**
  - Sound absorption coefficient αw up to 0.95; sound reduction index Rw up to 42 dB (EN ISO 140-3, EN ISO 717-1).
- **Health and Environmental Safety:**
  - Products must comply with REACH (no hazardous substances).
  - Resistance to mold, bacteria, and insects is tested (EOTA/ACERMI procedures).
  - No chemical irritants; non-itch, safe for installers and occupants.

## 4. Tunisian Context and Limitations

- No valuable, Tunisia-specific certification or standard for textile insulation was found.
- Most insulation products in Tunisia (including textile-based) are imported or manufactured to comply with European CE/EN standards.
- Local authorities may require additional documentation or testing for fire and health safety, but these are generally based on international norms.

## Summary (Bullet Points)
- No authoritative Tunisian certification/standard found; international/European standards are used.
- CE marking and EN standards (EN 13501-1, EN 13171, EN 12086, EN ISO 140-3, etc.) are the main references for textile insulation.
- Fire rating: B-s1,d0 (with facing), C-s2,d0 (unfaced) per EN 13501-1.
- Acoustic: αw up to 0.95, Rw up to 42 dB.
- Health: REACH compliance, no hazardous substances, resistance to mold/insects.
- All data sources are cited above.
