# Social Impact & HR: Training and Readiness of Women and Youth in Tunisia’s Textile Sector

## Readiness of Women and Youth for Training

Women and youth in Tunisia are considered highly trainable for sewing and production roles in the textile sector. The International Trade Centre (ITC) GTEX/MENATEX project and local vocational centers have reported strong participation rates among women and young people, especially in Monastir and Sousse. The sector’s tradition of female employment and the presence of established training programs facilitate rapid upskilling.

## Existing Vocational Paths

Tunisia has a network of vocational training centers (Centres de Formation Professionnelle) offering textile and garment production courses. These programs are open to both women and youth, with a focus on practical skills such as sewing, machine operation, and quality control. Many centers partner with industry to ensure job placement after training. [ITC News, 2024](https://www.intracen.org/news-and-events/news/new-boost-for-the-tunisian-textile-and-apparel-industry)
