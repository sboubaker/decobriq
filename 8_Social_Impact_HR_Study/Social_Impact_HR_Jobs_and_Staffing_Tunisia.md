# Social Impact & HR: Jobs and Staffing in Tunisia’s Textile Recycling Sector

## Job Creation Potential per 1,000m² Production

Recent studies and international benchmarks suggest that textile recycling and upcycling facilities can create between **15 and 25 direct jobs per 1,000m²** of production space, depending on the level of mechanization and the product mix. In Tunisia, pilot projects and industry reports indicate that job creation is on the higher end due to the labor-intensive nature of sorting, manual processing, and artisanal upcycling. For example, the International Trade Centre (ITC) GTEX/MENATEX project reported the creation of over 3,140 jobs in the Tunisian textile sector since 2017, with a strong focus on circular and sustainable production methods.

| Production Area (m²) | Estimated Direct Jobs Created |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| 1,000                | 15–25                        |
| 5,000                | 75–125                       |
| 10,000               | 150–250                      |

## Staffing Needs by Role

A typical 1,000m² textile recycling/upcycling facility in Tunisia would require a mix of the following roles:

| Role                | Estimated Number per 1,000m² | Notes                                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Machine Operators   | 4–6                          | For shredding, pressing, basic machinery |
| Artisans/Upcyclers  | 6–10                         | Manual sorting, sewing, finishing        |
| Collectors/Sorters  | 2–4                          | Collection, initial sorting              |
| Logistics Staff     | 2–3                          | Transport, warehouse, delivery           |
| Supervisors/Admin   | 1–2                          | Management, HR, reporting                |

These ratios are based on ITC project data and local SME interviews. [ITC News, 2024](https://www.intracen.org/news-and-events/news/new-boost-for-the-tunisian-textile-and-apparel-industry)

## Full-Time vs. Part-Time/Seasonal Workers

- **Full-time staff:** 60–70% (machine operators, supervisors, core artisans)
- **Part-time/seasonal:** 30–40% (collectors, some artisans, logistics during peak periods)

Seasonal fluctuations are common, especially during major clothing collection drives or high-demand periods for insulation products. [Circle Economy, 2020](https://circleeconomy.medium.com/unwanted-clothes-happy-workers-exploring-the-potential-for-circular-textiles-to-have-a-positive-e99b24010938)

## Local Workforce Participation (with Focus on Women)

- The textile sector is the **largest industrial employer in Tunisia**, with women making up over 70% of the workforce in many regions, especially in Monastir and Sousse.
- Local women are highly represented in sewing, sorting, and artisanal roles. Projects like GTEX/MENATEX have specifically targeted women’s employment, resulting in 422 new jobs for women and 218 promotions since 2017.
- Social and family support is crucial for long-term retention. Community-based models and women’s cooperatives have shown strong sustainability, especially when paired with training and social support.

## Bullet-Point Conclusions

- **15–25 direct jobs** can be created per 1,000m² of textile recycling/upcycling production in Tunisia.
- Staffing needs include machine operators, artisans, collectors, logistics, and supervisors, with a strong role for women in artisanal and production roles.
- About **60–70% of jobs are full-time**, with the remainder being part-time or seasonal.
- Local women are well-positioned to fill and sustain these roles, especially with targeted training and community support.
