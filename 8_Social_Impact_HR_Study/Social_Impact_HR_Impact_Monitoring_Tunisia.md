# Social Impact & HR: Impact Monitoring and Verification in Tunisia’s Textile Sector

## Key Monitoring Metrics

Textile social impact projects in Tunisia typically track:
- **Jobs created** (by gender, age, contract type)
- **Production volumes** (tons of recycled/upcycled textiles)
- **CO2 saved** (tons, based on lifecycle analysis)
- **Water and energy savings**
- **Training hours delivered**
- **Wages and benefits distributed**

These metrics are aligned with international standards (e.g., ITC, UNIDO, World Bank). [ITC News, 2024](https://www.intracen.org/news-and-events/news/new-boost-for-the-tunisian-textile-and-apparel-industry)

## Independent Verification

- Impact data is often verified by third-party auditors, project partners (e.g., ITC, UNIDO), or through government labor and environment agencies.
- Companies may publish annual sustainability or impact reports, with data reviewed by external consultants.

- Transparent reporting increases eligibility for funding and recognition.
