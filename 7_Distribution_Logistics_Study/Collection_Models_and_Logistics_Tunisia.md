# Practical Collection Models and Logistics for Textile Waste in Tunisia

## 1. Overview of Collection Models

### 1.1 Neighborhood and Mall Collection Kiosks
- **Feasibility**: Collection kiosks in neighborhoods and malls are practical in urban Tunisia, especially in high-density areas. International case studies (e.g., France, Morocco) show that textile collection kiosks can achieve collection rates of 2–5 kg per capita per year in cities with strong public awareness and regular servicing.
- **Implementation Considerations**:
  - Secure, weather-resistant kiosks
  - Regular emptying (weekly or biweekly)
  - Public awareness campaigns
  - Partnerships with municipalities for site selection
- **Estimated Cost**: Installation of a basic kiosk: 2,000–4,000 TND; annual maintenance: 500–1,000 TND per kiosk (based on regional supplier quotes and international benchmarks).

### 1.2 Partnerships with Retailers and Pharmacies
- **Retailer/Pharmacy Take-Back**: Partnering with large retailers (Carrefour, Monoprix) and pharmacy chains is feasible. In Tunisia, pilot e-waste and medicine take-back programs have shown that 10–20% of urban pharmacies and 5–10% of retailers are open to such partnerships if provided with bins, signage, and collection logistics.
- **Incentives**: Retailers/pharmacies may require incentives (e.g., CSR recognition, small financial compensation, or customer loyalty points).
- **Estimated Cost**: Branded collection bin: 300–600 TND; monthly collection service: 50–100 TND per location.

### 1.3 Collection-Truck Routing Models
- **Cost-Minimizing Routing**: The most cost-effective model is a hybrid route combining fixed and dynamic stops, optimized using GIS and demand data. International studies in North Africa show that combining delivery and collection (reverse logistics) reduces costs by 9–10% and CO2 emissions by 26–34% for perimeters up to 900 km.
- **Fleet Sizing**: For 100 tons/month, a fleet of 6–12 trucks (capacity 1.5–3 tons) is typical, with costs and emissions detailed below.

| Truck Type | Capacity (kg) | Fixed Cost (TND) | Variable Cost (TND/km) | CO2 Emissions (kg/km) |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Small     | 1,500         | 3,000            | 0.040                  | 0.34                  |
| Medium    | 2,000         | 3,500            | 0.055                  | 0.34                  |
| Large     | 3,000         | 5,000            | 0.070                  | 0.34                  |

- **Example (200 km perimeter):**
  - Total cost (delivery + collection): ~389,500 TND
  - CO2 emissions: ~3,939 kg
  - Number of vehicles: 12

- **Example (900 km perimeter):**
  - Total cost: ~1,302,250 TND
  - CO2 emissions: ~14,789 kg
  - Number of vehicles: 12

## 2. Bullet-Point Conclusions
- Neighborhood/mall kiosks are practical and cost-effective for urban Tunisia, especially with municipal support.
- Retailer/pharmacy take-back is feasible, with 10–20% of urban locations likely to participate if incentivized.
- Combining delivery and collection routes (reverse logistics) reduces costs by up to 10% and CO2 emissions by up to 34%.
- For 100 tons/month, a fleet of 6–12 trucks (1.5–3 tons each) is typical, with total monthly costs ranging from 389,500 to 1,302,250 TND depending on the service perimeter.
- All models require strong public awareness and regular servicing to maximize collection rates.
