# Effective Sales Channels for Building Materials in Tunisia

## 1. Overview of Sales Channels

### 1.1 Homebuyers: Contractors vs. Self-Install
- **Contractor Use:** In Tunisia, 70–80% of homebuyers rely on contractors for new builds and major renovations. Self-installation is more common for minor works and finishing, representing 20–30% of the market.
- **Implication:** Targeting contractors and construction firms is essential for market penetration, especially for new or innovative materials like Deco'Briq.

### 1.2 Eco-Shops and Building Supply Chains
- **Eco-Shops:** Eco-focused retail is emerging but remains a niche. Most eco-shops are concentrated in Tunis and major cities, with limited national reach. However, demand for sustainable materials is growing, especially among younger and environmentally conscious buyers.
- **Building Supply Chains:** Large building supply chains (e.g., COMAF, Bouzgarrou MACO, Général Bâtiment) dominate the market, with 10+ agencies each and 20,000+ products. They serve both professionals and individuals, and are open to stocking innovative products if demand and certification are demonstrated.
- **Likelihood to Stock Deco'Briq:** High, if product is certified and supported by marketing/awareness campaigns.

### 1.3 B2B Sales: Hotels and Construction Firms
- **Hotels/Construction Firms:** B2B sales to hotels, real estate developers, and large construction firms are a major channel for building materials. These clients require product certification, technical documentation, and reliable supply.
- **Reaching B2B Clients:**
  - Direct sales teams and technical presentations
  - Participation in construction trade shows (e.g., Carthage Building Expo)
  - Partnerships with architects and engineering consultancies
- **Estimated Market Share:** B2B (hotels, construction firms, developers) accounts for 30–40% of building material sales in Tunisia.
