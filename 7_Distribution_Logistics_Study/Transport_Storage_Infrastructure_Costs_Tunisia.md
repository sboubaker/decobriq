# Transport and Storage Infrastructure for Textile Waste in Tunisia

## 1. Required Transport and Storage Infrastructure

### 1.1 Transport Fleet and Routing
- For a throughput of 100 tons/month, a typical fleet consists of 6–12 trucks (1.5–3 tons each), as per regional logistics benchmarks.
- **Road Freight Costs:**
  - Average cost for road freight in Tunisia: 1.0–1.5 TND per ton-km (varies by distance, fuel, and road quality).
  - Fuel (diesel) price: 2.205 TND/litre (Jan 2025)
  - Road quality in Tunisia is variable; urban and coastal routes are generally good, but rural/remote areas may increase costs by 10–20% due to slower speeds and higher maintenance.

| Truck Type | Capacity (kg) | Fixed Cost (TND) | Variable Cost (TND/km) |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Small     | 1,500         | 3,000            | 0.040                  |
| Medium    | 2,000         | 3,500            | 0.055                  |
| Large     | 3,000         | 5,000            | 0.070                  |

### 1.2 Warehouse Sizing and Location
- For 100 tons/month, a warehouse of 300–500 m² is typically required (assuming 200–350 kg/m² stacking density for baled textiles, 2–3m stacking height).
- **Location:** Proximity to main roads, industrial zones, or ports (e.g., Rades, Sfax, Bizerte) is recommended for cost efficiency and access.
- **Estimated Cost:**
  - Rental: 8–15 TND/m²/month (industrial zones, 2025 rates)
  - Total monthly rent for 400 m²: 3,200–6,000 TND
  - Construction: 1,000–1,500 TND/m² (if building new)

| Warehouse Size (m²) | Monthly Rent (TND) | Construction Cost (TND) |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 300                | 2,400–4,500       | 300,000–450,000         |
| 400                | 3,200–6,000       | 400,000–600,000         |
| 500                | 4,000–7,500       | 500,000–750,000         |

### 1.3 Storage Requirements (Cold/Dry)
- **Textile waste requires dry, well-ventilated storage.**
  - No cold storage is needed unless storing for >6 months or in high-humidity coastal areas.
  - Relative humidity should be kept below 65% to prevent mold.
  - Basic warehouse with concrete floor, metal roof, and ventilation is sufficient.

### 1.4 Impact of Road Quality and Fuel Costs
- **Road Quality:**
  - Good in urban/coastal areas; variable in rural/interior regions.
  - Poor road quality increases vehicle maintenance costs by 10–20% and may require more robust vehicles.
- **Fuel Costs:**
  - Diesel: 2.205 TND/litre (Jan 2025)
  - Fuel is a major cost driver; a 200 km round trip for a 3-ton truck consumes ~40–50 litres, costing ~90–110 TND per trip.

| Fuel Type | Price (TND/litre) |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Diesel    | 2.205             |
| Gasoline  | 2.525–2.855       |

## 2. Bullet-Point Conclusions
- For 100 tons/month, a 300–500 m² warehouse and a fleet of 6–12 trucks (1.5–3 tons each) are required.
- Warehouse rental costs: 8–15 TND/m²/month; total 3,200–6,000 TND/month for 400 m².
- Road freight costs: 1.0–1.5 TND/ton-km; fuel (diesel) is 2.205 TND/litre.
- Dry, ventilated storage is sufficient; cold storage is not required for textile waste.
- Poor road quality and rising fuel costs can increase logistics costs by 10–20%.
