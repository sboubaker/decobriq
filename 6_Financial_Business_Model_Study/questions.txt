6. Financial & Business Model Study

a. Estimate CAPEX per m² (machinery, rent, utilities, labor).
How many m² of insulation can be produced per month with planned equipment?
What depreciation schedule (5 years?) applies to machinery in Tunisia?
How do utility costs (electricity, rent per m²) scale with volume?

b. Calculate OPEX per m² (materials, staff, packaging, marketing).
What is the total labor time required to produce and install 1 m²?
What is local cost of consumables (thread, adhesives, packaging)?
How do distribution costs per m² vary by region?

c. What pricing yields viable margins at different sales volumes?
At what price per m² do we break even at 10%, 25%, and 50% capacity?
What margin is needed to sustain 30% annual revenue growth?
How sensitive are margins to input cost inflation (energy, labor, waste)?

d. What funding sources and interest rates are available locally/regionally?
What are bank loan rates for SMEs (onshore/offshore) in Tunisia?
Are grants available with no equity dilution?
Can crowdfunding or diaspora investors be mobilized?

e. How might currency devaluation or power outages impact cost/revenue?
What is the projected dinar inflation rate, and how will it affect revenue over 5 years?
Can energy backup (solar/Genset) maintain production during outages—and at what cost?
How can we hedge currency risk on imported equipment?
