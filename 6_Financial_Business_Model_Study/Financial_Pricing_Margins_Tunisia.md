# Section c: Pricing, Margins, and Sensitivity Analysis for Textile Insulation in Tunisia

## 1. Pricing for Viable Margins at Different Sales Volumes

### Typical Ex-Factory Price Ranges (2024)

| Sales Volume (m²/month) | Typical Ex-Factory Price (TND/m²) | Notes/Assumptions                |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 5,000                  | 22 – 26                            | Small batch, low scale           |
| 20,000                 | 18 – 22                            | Medium scale, some automation    |
| 50,000+                | 15 – 18                            | Large scale, high efficiency     |

## 2. Break-Even Price per m² at 10%, 25%, and 50% Capacity

Assumptions:
- Fixed costs (annual): 300,000 TND (rent, admin, depreciation)
- Variable OPEX: 15 TND/m² (see Section b)
- Full capacity: 50,000 m²/month (600,000 m²/year)

| Utilization | Output (m²/year) | Fixed Cost per m² (TND) | Total Cost per m² (TND) | Break-Even Price (TND/m²) |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| 10%         | 60,000           | 5.00                    | 20.00                   | 20.00                     |
| 25%         | 150,000          | 2.00                    | 17.00                   | 17.00                     |
| 50%         | 300,000          | 1.00                    | 16.00                   | 16.00                     |

- **Note:** Break-even = total cost per m²; excludes profit margin.

## 3. Margin Needed to Sustain 30% Annual Revenue Growth

- **Target:** 30% annual revenue growth requires reinvestment and buffer for working capital.
- **Industry rule:** Net margin of 12–15% is typically needed for high-growth manufacturing SMEs in Tunisia.
- **Example:**
  - At 20 TND/m² sale price, OPEX 15 TND/m², fixed cost 2 TND/m² (25% capacity):
    - Gross margin: 3 TND/m² (15%)
    - Net margin after tax/finance: ~2 TND/m² (10%)
- **To sustain 30% growth:**
  - **Aim for gross margin ≥ 15%** (i.e., price at least 17–18 TND/m² at 25%+ capacity)

## 4. Margin Sensitivity to Input Cost Inflation (Energy, Labor, Waste)

### Sensitivity Table: Impact of 10% Input Cost Increase

| Input Cost Component | Baseline (TND/m²) | +10% Scenario (TND/m²) | Margin Impact (TND/m²) |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Energy              | 2.00              | 2.20                   | -0.20                  |
| Labor               | 3.00              | 3.30                   | -0.30                  |
| Waste/Materials     | 7.50              | 8.25                   | -0.75                  |
| **Total**           | 12.50             | 13.75                  | -1.25                  |

- **If sale price is fixed at 18 TND/m²:**
  - Gross margin drops from 5.5 TND/m² to 4.25 TND/m² (from 31% to 24%).
- **If all input costs rise 10%:**
  - Margin drops by 1.25 TND/m² (7 percentage points at 18 TND/m² sale price).

### Margin Sensitivity Summary
- **Most sensitive:** Raw material/waste cost (largest share of OPEX)
- **Moderate:** Labor (especially with SMIG increases)
- **Least:** Energy (unless major price shock)

## 5. Summary (Bullet Points)

- **Break-even price per m²**: 20 TND (10% capacity), 17 TND (25%), 16 TND (50%)
- **Viable gross margin for growth:** ≥15% (target price 17–18 TND/m² at 25%+ capacity)
- **Margin sensitivity:** 10% input cost inflation reduces margin by ~7 percentage points
- **Material/waste cost** is the most sensitive input; energy and labor also significant
- **Tunisian data** is used where available; international/industry estimates supplement gaps
- **All values** are for 2024 and should be updated for inflation in future years
