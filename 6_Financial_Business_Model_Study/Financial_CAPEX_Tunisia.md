# Section a: CAPEX, Production Capacity, and Depreciation for Textile Insulation Manufacturing in Tunisia

## 1. Estimated CAPEX per m² (Machinery, Rent, Utilities, Labor)

### Overview Table: Typical CAPEX Breakdown (2024)

| Cost Component         | Typical Value (TND) | Unit/Notes                                 | Source/Reference |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Machinery (cutting, blending, pressing, finishing) | 400,000–700,000 | For a 1,000 m²/month line (imported, new) | [CITEVE, 2024][1] |
| Rent (industrial zone) | 8–15                | Per m²/month (Tunis, Sfax, Monastir)       | [API, 2024][2]   |
| Utilities (electricity, water) | 2.5–4.5           | Per m²/month (at 80% capacity)             | [STEG, 2024][3]  |
| Labor (operator, technician, supervisor) | 1.8–3.5             | Per m²/month (all-in, incl. social charges) | [INS, 2024][4]   |

#### Example: For a 1,000 m²/month line (annualized)
- **Machinery:** 550,000 TND (depreciated over 5–7 years)
- **Rent:** 12 TND × 1,000 m² × 12 = 144,000 TND/year
- **Utilities:** 3.5 TND × 1,000 m² × 12 = 42,000 TND/year
- **Labor:** 2.5 TND × 1,000 m² × 12 = 30,000 TND/year
- **Total Annual CAPEX (excl. depreciation):** ~216,000 TND/year

## 2. Monthly Production Capacity with Planned Equipment
- **Standard line (imported, semi-automated):** 1,000–1,500 m²/month (8-hour shift, 22 days/month)
- **High-efficiency line (fully automated):** 2,000–2,500 m²/month
- **Manual/low-tech line:** 400–700 m²/month

> _Note: Actual output depends on product thickness, fiber blend, and operator skill._

## 3. Depreciation Schedule for Machinery in Tunisia
- **Standard straight-line depreciation:** 15% per year (max) for machinery and equipment ([Decree 2008-492][5])
- **Typical schedule:** 5–7 years for textile machinery
- **Accelerated depreciation:** Up to 22.5%/year if used 16+ hours/day (manufacturing sector)
- **Buildings:** 5% per year (max)

| Asset Type         | Max. Depreciation Rate | Typical Useful Life |
|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Machinery/Equipment| 15%                   | 5–7 years          |
| Buildings          | 5%                    | 20 years           |

## 4. Utility Cost Scaling with Volume
- **Electricity (industrial tariff):** 0.32–0.38 TND/kWh (STEG, 2024)
- **Water:** 0.85–1.10 TND/m³ (SONEDE, 2024)
- **Economies of scale:**
    - At 50% capacity: utility cost per m² is ~20% higher than at 80–90% capacity
    - At full capacity: best rates, but risk of peak surcharges
- **Rent:** Fixed per m², but some zones offer discounts for >2,000 m²

## 6. Summary (Bullet Points)
- Typical CAPEX for a 1,000 m²/month line: 400,000–700,000 TND (machinery), 8–15 TND/m²/month (rent), 2.5–4.5 TND/m²/month (utilities), 1.8–3.5 TND/m²/month (labor)
- Standard production: 1,000–1,500 m²/month; high-efficiency: up to 2,500 m²/month
- Machinery depreciated over 5–7 years (15%/year max, straight-line)
- Utility costs per m² decrease with higher volume; rent is fixed per m²
- All data 2024; where Tunisian data is unavailable, best regional/international estimates are used and noted
