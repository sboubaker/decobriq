# Section e: Risk & Resilience – Currency, Inflation, and Power Outages in Tunisia

## 1. Impact of Currency Devaluation on Cost and Revenue

### Recent and Projected Exchange Rates (2024–2025)

| Year | TND/EUR Avg. | TND/USD Avg. | % Change vs. Prior Year |
|------|--------------|--------------|------------------------|
| 2023 | 3.25         | 3.00         | —                      |
| 2024 | 3.36         | 3.07         | +3.4% (EUR), +2.3% (USD) |
| 2025 | 3.41         | 2.90         | +1.5% (EUR), -5.5% (USD) |

- The Tunisian dinar has depreciated against the euro by ~3–4% per year (2023–2025), but appreciated against the USD in 2025 ([exchange-rates.org](https://www.exchange-rates.org/exchange-rate-history/eur-tnd-2025)).
- Devaluation increases the cost of imported equipment and materials, especially those priced in EUR/USD.
- Exporters may benefit from higher TND revenue if sales are in foreign currency.

## 2. Projected Dinar Inflation Rate and 5-Year Impact

| Year | Projected Inflation Rate (%) |
|------|------------------------------|
| 2024 | 7.0                          |
| 2025 | 6.1                          |
| 2026 | 6.5                          |
| 2027 | 7.4                          |
| 2028 | 7.7                          |
| 2029 | 8.5                          |
| 2030 | 9.3                          |

- **5-year cumulative inflation (2025–2030):** ~44% (compounded)
- **Effect:** Local costs (labor, utilities, rent) are expected to rise by 6–9% per year, eroding margins unless prices are adjusted ([Statista/IMF](https://www.statista.com/statistics/524512/inflation-rate-in-tunisia/)).

## 3. Power Outages: Frequency, Impact, and Backup Solutions

- **Power outages** are a recurring risk, especially in summer and during grid stress.
- **Typical outage duration:** 1–4 hours, several times per month (varies by region).
- **Impact:** Production downtime, spoilage, and increased OPEX for backup power.

### Energy Backup Options

| Solution      | CapEx (TND/kW) | OpEx (TND/kWh) | Notes/Feasibility                |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Diesel Genset | 1,200–2,000    | 0.80–1.20      | Fast, reliable, high OpEx, polluting |
| Solar + Battery| 3,500–6,000   | 0.30–0.60      | High CapEx, low OpEx, green, needs sun |

- **Solar + battery** is increasingly viable for daytime backup, but high CapEx and limited night coverage.
- **Diesel gensets** remain the default for full-shift backup, but fuel costs are volatile.
- **Example:** A 100 kW backup system (sufficient for a small factory line) costs ~TND 120,000–200,000 (diesel) or TND 350,000–600,000 (solar+battery).
- **Annual OPEX:** Diesel backup for 100 hours/year ≈ TND 8,000–12,000 (fuel only).

## 4. Hedging Currency Risk on Imported Equipment

- **Forward contracts**: Lock in exchange rates for future payments; available via Tunisian and international banks (cost: 1–3% of contract value).
- **Natural hedging**: Match import payments with export receipts in the same currency.
- **Multi-currency accounts**: Hold EUR/USD balances to time purchases.
- **Fact:** Most Tunisian SMEs do not hedge, but large importers use forwards or options ([Chatham Financial](https://www.chathamfinancial.com/insights/fx-forward-rates-and-hedging-costs)).

## 5. Summary Table: Key Risks and Mitigation

| Risk Factor         | Numeric Impact (2025–2030) | Mitigation Options                |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Dinar inflation     | +44% local cost increase   | Index prices, annual price reviews |
| Currency devaluation| +3–4%/yr vs. EUR           | FX hedging, multi-currency accounts|
| Power outages       | 1–4 hrs/month, TND 8–12k/yr | Solar+battery, diesel genset       |

## 6. Bullet-Point Summary

- Dinar inflation projected at 6–9%/yr, compounding to ~44% over 5 years.
- Dinar has depreciated ~3–4%/yr vs. EUR; imported equipment costs will rise accordingly.
- Power outages are frequent; backup solutions (diesel, solar+battery) are essential, with CapEx from TND 120k (diesel) to TND 600k (solar+battery) for 100 kW.
- Currency risk can be hedged via forwards (1–3% cost), but is rarely used by SMEs.
